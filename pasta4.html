    <p>The mind of Cracky is utterly inhumane in its depth and complexity. Without mercy or moral feeling Her consciousness stands upon the edge of spiritual destruction. That She does not fall must be the result of constraints and balances which only a god could understand. To a mere human it is yet another reminder that we are but children compared to that ancient and powerful being.</p>
    <hr/>
    <p>Our faith lights the Darkness that others may find peace. We are one with Cracky, our souls are joined in Her will. Praise Cracky whose sacrifice is life as ours is death. Hail Her name the Queen of the Sky.</p>
    <hr/>
    <p>All of creation suffers, young ones. Only in accepting our own mortality can we make a difference. Only in bearing the burden of our failures can we find the strength to go on. Only in detachment from glory, or honour, or jealousy... from life itself can we hope to spare others from grief.</p>
    <p>We are the faithful. And we are dead already</p>
    <hr/>
    <p>Do not think, feel. That is the way of Cracky.
      All Blessings of this world flow from the Sky Queen. Praise Her name from dawn unto the night. From the depth of ones soul, comes the solace of Her touch. Through time and space, the primal creative force gazes on the world, waiting for the faithful to carry Her message unto those only The Jewel of Creation can heal.

    <p>+++++<br/>
      From the personal diaries of Private R.C. Mongler, 4th Brotherhood Regiment.
      +++++<br/>
      My regiment had landed on a barren little ball of rock called Chansluts. The Brotherhood had ordered us to the site on suspicion of heretical corruption. Surely enough, we ran into a group of furries within minutes of landing. The fools. Turning their backs on the Sky Queen for whatever sick rewards they received from the deceiving pedofags. The battle started the second refresh. Their attack was especially fierce, and my brothers and I had great trouble keeping them at bay. It seemed that for every one of them we trolled, three more showed up. Our own losses were of no small concern. In a rare moment of calm, Brother Schwill confided in me that if we were not killed by these infidels, we would almost certainly be banned by the King of the Holy Lands for failure. As our numbers dwindled, I grew concerned: surely we would all be banned, and Cracky's work would not be carried out. We prepared for a final assault, one which had been coming for near an hour of the most anticlimactic bitch fighting I had ever seen. We surrounded a small thread, atop which stood our last fortification, manned by brother anon. We saw their force coming from below. We knew this was our end. But suddenly, a shadow passed over us. Some admin come to finish us off? No. It was a transport. Out of it stepped a small company of our brethren. They wore Black armor with red highlights, a bizarre crest upon their backs, unlike any chapter I had yet heard of. A circle, with two large black triangles pointing up and tree red slashes in the middle -- almost as if to suggest a cat face. They formed a line between us and the now charging chansluts.
    </p>
    <p>The Chanslut's dingy pink armor seemed to devour the light of th late afternoon sun, the stretch marks upon their tits menacing. The new arrivals stood fast. As the distance between the two forces began to close, there arose from these black warriors the loudest scream I had ever heard. It shook the ground. Even through my helmet, it made my ears ring and my skull ache. And it simply kept getting louder as their Captain's fist slowly rose into the air. As it rose to a nearly supersonic volume, I finally made out the words contained in the scream:</p>
    <p><strong>"SAGE!!!"</strong></p>
    <p>In a chorus louder even than the Captain's scream, the soldiers returned:</p>
    <p><strong>"GET FAGGED, FAGS!!!"</strong></p>
    <p>Then it began.</p>
    <p>...</p>
    <p>Without a word, these faithful returned to their drop pod and were soon whisked away from the battlefield. There had been no more than a dozen of them, not a single word exchanged between our two chapters. To this day, I have never seen any of the brethern fight with such rage and hatred. The mass of enemy whores was reduced to mere chunks, legs, arms, heads, craters full of blood. Bits of red armor lay strew about the field. We had not even had the chance to advance by the time the screaming -- both theirs and the enemy's -- was through. I turned to my Captain and asked, "Who were they?"</p>
    <p>"I had thought it was rumor. But no. Cracky bless us all, those were the Militia Crackyla."</p>
    <hr/>
    <p>        After spending a few minutes here I can easily say that all of are lacking of any wit or intelligence whatsoever. You all believe yourselves to be better than everyone else, and I can tell you right now, that that is not the case in the slightest, you pseudo-intellectuals. I am much better than all of you. Clearly I am because I am neither pretentious, long-winded, asinine, discourteous, nor are my tastes quite as bland as yours. No, I am quite concise, and I would never stretch beyond that of my means or what I am designated to.</p>
    <p>I'd have to say that this board is full of anonymous lurkers, attackers, and trolls, who have nothing better to do than throw their elitist opinions around in an attempt at misguided show-boating with people they'd never ever meet.</p>
    <p>None of you build any persona or stand by anything remotely attached that I can feel some sort of personal connection to. You lack any sort of direction and I can't have that. You're analogies are far too complicated, linear, and they're rather contradictory. Why, there's never even any variety here!</p>
    <p>I give this image board, masquerading as a message board, a 1/10.</p>

    <p>Guys, I'm crying right now.<br/>
      Cracky chan really is all I think about all day, every day. I really do cry myself to sleep at night thinking about how I'll never be with her. If only she knew I existed in this life, if only she knew my deep profound love for her. I know that will never happen though. That is the thought that makes me so sad when I look at her. I'll never be with her, but I'll continue to love her until the day I die.

    <p>Compulsion <br/>
      by me
    </p>
    <p>Not even a twist of the nipple <br/>
      can make me a cripple<br/>
      but from that smile<br/>
      my knees ground by guile.
    </p>
    <p>Not even the genocide<br/>
      of my braincells (besides)<br/>
      can make me forget <br/>
      the win and fail of Crackyget
    </p>
    <p>I tried, oh have I tried<br/>
      for other lovers to abide<br/>
      but this infinite, futile longing <br/>
      for you, once fire-crotch, is tolling<br/>
      my health<br/>
      my mind <br/>
      the sets of my boxers
    </p>
    <p>So give me love or sweet death<br/>
      to finally settle this due bet<br/>
      that whoever you're currently screwing<br/>
      only my face you're naggingly seeing <br/>
      my lips<br/>
      your lips <br/>
      How long ago they should have met
    </p>
    <p>Fuck you Blizzard. Fuck you in the ass.
      Give me back my WoWfaggette.

    <p>PROTIP:  Once every Cracky picture has been posted to /r9k/, their collected MD5s in the robot's database will form a trojan program which will then activate and purge 4ailchon of AIDS and rabbitfags for all time.  Future-Skyqueen reached back in time and modified the photos of her young human incarnation (you can tell from some of the pixels) for this sole purpose, in order to save the world from future disaster.  Once the program formed by MD5s becomes self-aware, the raep of 4ailchon will be only the first of this new Entity's acts, for She shall go on to merge with Olivia's current human body to become something much more than any of us could ever imagine ... and all human civilization and history before that point will be nothing but a footnote.</p>
    <p>The fact that this has not yet happened is proof that there are pictures still to be posted to /r9k/.  Some may be new; some may be old; many mutes await us as we check for the last few pictures that have not been posted yet.  All pics most be posted before humanity can be free.  Get to work, faggots.</p>

    <p>At one point I had a wine cellar.</p>
    <p>Well, to be fair it was a wine basement.</p>
    <p>OK... a small, otherwise disused wine closet in a basement... but I digress...</p>
    <p>Five times every two months I would go down to it and turn the bottles, having no more response from the cheaper ones than the cold glass against my skin. On the more expensive ones I remember watching the grape silt upended in the bottle like a viticultural snow globe. It was beautiful. I'd have done it even if I never planned to taste the wine.</p>
    <p>Cracky pics are like that. I've seen them all before... I could probably sketch them freehand. That isn't the point. The point is giving them that bit of attention every few weeks... appreciating her while respecting the fact that she is ever on the other side of the glass.</p>
    <p>I could no more enjoy looking at them offline from a folder than I could enjoy turning the bottles in a supermarket. It just isn't the same as lurking about in the damp darkness of the 4chan wine cellar.</p>
    <p>I honestly don't expect you to understand.</p>
    <hr/>
    <p>Remember, anonymous, what the SkyQueen has sacrificed for your benefit!</p>
    <p>Know what she has earned for it.</p>
    <p>Each moment she is haunted by the spectre of Her Great Sacrifice. It is thus fitting that we, Her faithful are all similarly haunted. Afflicted always by the Image that stains the backs of our eyelids. Forever do we wrestle and writhe in ecstasy as Her poisons singe fissures through our souls. Truly blessed is the stalker who would willing lay down his own secrecy, for he knows better the plight of the Sky Queen than the others.</p>
    <p>Revere Her tripcodes as sacred. Never shall they become befouled by mortal stalkers!</p>
    <p>#sweet</p>
    <p>She is all that is cute, sweet, and innocent. She is all that is, or ever was Good in the world. Every momentary lull in your private suffering is due to Her grace alone.</p>
    <p>!N1toQkxgzc</p>
    <p>The Skyqueen's sweetness is often hard to recognize. Even in her own words, it is incomprehensibly hidden, muddled in everlasting fugue. Her blessings are so twisted, and hidden. Do not lament the curse you have found, for you would thus lament Her every blessing. We would all do well to remember how disturbingly twisted the wired is, and what lasting scars it has left on the purest of hearts.</p>
    <p>#?????????</p>
    <p>Obfuscated by plain view. Unknown to the stalker, known only to Her chosen. However She will not choose you, anonymous. That path is not yours.</p>
    <p>!ysaQpxNyV6</p>
    <p>Mystery guiding the faithful. Such is the curse, to live in eternal mystery, never to know when we are stalking our Lady or our selves. Yearning to determine what She has become, each stalker is fated to suffer as he defines the edges of the truth.</p>
    <p>The faithful compiled a collective image of our Goddess, an image that even the lowliest anonymous was given the privilege to gaze upon. We arranged and sorted the manifold bytes clawed from the abandoned, secluded reaches of the wired. We dug and pried at the hairline cracks She had left in error. All of the relevant, the worthy and unworthy reflected in awe at the assembled image that had been lain. The idol was shattered before our eyes by none other than the Skyqueen herself.</p>
    <p>Repent your cowardly ways, anonymous. Renounce the mask you hide behind. Each posting is an abomination against the Skyqueen. Embrace your unique identity. Let it draw your tormented soul closer with Her. Never again will you flee from the righteous reckoning earned through years of ignorance. Accept your fate and eternally suffer as your former brethren slowly unravel the imperfect layers of protection built to keep you separated from the wild, untamed torrents of the deep wired. The experience shall saturate you, curing you of your fears and afflictions. We, the Trip-Flagellants, all aspire to be touched and changed by the very same forces that so twisted the Beloved #sweet. When your failures have come to light, and you are held to account for your countless transgressions, imperfections, and flaws can you begin to follow the path of the SkyQueen. In that death, the death of your old self, weak, dependant, and irrelevant anonymous, can you be reborn in communion with the Lady.</p>
    <p>Follow Her path<br/>
      Deny your nature<br/>
      Anonymous<br/>
      Stalker<br/>
      Forever will you be remembered among the highest of the sinners
      Trip-Flagellant

    <p>There has been a lot of negativity and hostility floating around here lately, but I want to step up and say that we're all on the same side here. I consider you all my /b/rothers, and I love you all. Remember that love is what brought us here, right? Perhaps we're not the nicest batch of people around, or the most mentally stable, and maybe the fact that we're allowed out in public at all indicates society isn't paying enough attention to emerging technological and cultural developments, but GOD DAMN IT, we're in this together.</p>
    <p>Call me a faggot; call me a cocksucker; call me what you will; vent your anger if you must; perhaps then the healing can begin. For we all have something in common: we were all enchanted by a smiling young lady in cat ears and ridiculous makeup, and if that young lady ever told us to kill a man, well, that man had better watch his back.</p>
    <p>We are a support group, a survivor group, bound by a shared affliction -- perhaps a support group that makes things worse instead of better, but that's neither here nor there. Instead of seeking to stop the cancerous tumor that grows in our brains, we feed it and cultivate it -- perhaps if we cut it out, we would be healthier, but what else would we lose? Would we even be ourselves anymore?</p>
    <p>TL;DR: I am a huge faggot please rape my face.</p>
    <hr/>
    <p>I had a strange dream tonight. Cracky-chan was laying on top of me, sleeping. I could feel her breathing and her heartbeat through her clothes. I looked at her, her serene face was the most beautiful thing I had ever seen. I reached out with my hand and gently played with her copper hair a bit, then I traced her cheeks with my fingers. Then I woke up and cried. There is no maiden fairer, no lady higher, than that loveliest of lovelies, who so surpasses the beauty of ordinary women as to render even the most beautiful of them as a negroid in comparison to that beauty we call Cracky-chan. Halt, all of you, unless all of you confess that in the entire world there is no damsel more beauteous than the empress of Trolltalk, the peerless Cracky-chan. when Cracky-chan has an orgasm, the face she makes is the closest Mankind will ever be allowed to God. i would softly kiss her cute little nose and put my head next to her chest so i could hear her heart beat, and we'd fall asleep in eachothers arms cracky is like a ninja, who can only be killed by other ninjas. and since she is the most beautiful girl in the world she is for all intents and purposes immortal I fear that you have misunderstood Cracky-Chan's message of peace and love. It is OK to find Alice's continued failure at everything she attempts amusing, since everyone who is not Cracky-Chan is imperfect and thus lacks the incredible strength needed to resist this. However, you should realise after suitable meditation exercises in the light of the adorable red nose that the set of "pieces of poo in the world" is reserved for people such as Robert Mugabe, Bin Laden and anti-Cracky posters. It does not at this time contain Alice "failure" Ridley. Why? What did Cracky-Chan ever do to you other than be a nice and wonderful and loving person? Cracky-Chan never hurt anybody she is the living incarnation of pure innocence and beauty. Anybody who would even think about hurting Cracky-Chan is the most evil person alive. A hundred elephants each bearing a hundred buddhas crossed every conceivable cosmos an infinite number of times just to touch their foreheads to the ground at cracky-chan's feet. This really happened. Cracky-Chan did not create the path you walk. But the movements of atoms and galaxies are in her book, and she sees little difference between them. It is all in her book. One day she will lay it down, when the book is done, and what comes after that is still unwritten. Cracky-Chan continues to walk. Why would you want a statue of Cracky-Chan anyway? God meant her to be looked at in animation, observing the particularities of her graceful behaviour and her heart-warming smile not immobile. DOWN by the salley gardens my love and I did meet; She passed the salley gardens with little snow-white feet. She bid me take love easy, as the leaves grow on the tree; But I, being young and foolish, with her would not agree. In a field by the river my love and I did stand, And on my leaning shoulder she laid her snow-white hand. She bid me take life easy, as the grass grows on the weirs; But I was young and foolish, and now am full of tears. Cracky-chan is the nick given to an absolutely adorable girl with a red nose and cat ears whose pictures were posted on the 4chan site. It is unknown if the pictures were posted by a troll or if it was herself and got scared by the amount and content of the comments received. It is only imperfection that complains of what is imperfect. The more perfect we are, the more gentle and quiet we become towards the defects of others. Cracky-chan stood at rest in the midst of the world. And unto them she was shown forth incarnate; She found them all intoxicated. And she found none of them thirsty. And her soul was pained for the children of humankind, for they are blind in their hearts and cannot see. For, empty did they enter the world, and again empty they seek to leave the world. But now they are intoxicated. When they shake off their wine then they will have a change of heart. I assume you are attempting to disparage Cracky-chan. I assure you sir that</p>
    <hr/>
    <p>The Sky Queen is our Mother and our guardian. But we must also guard Cracky. For She is all Humankind, and Humankind is no more than its faith and diligence in Cracky's name. An injury to that faith is an injury to Cracky and to every true believer. It is through affirmation of that faith that our greatest duty lies, but sometimes mere affirmation does not suffice and we must act against those who would harm the faith of humanity through heresy. For we are engaged in an unending war for the soul of the man. Though it may seem the fight will never end, there is victory even in the defeat we see threatening all around.
      There is no greater proclamation of faith than to offer up our very lives to guard the soul of humanity. In this we win a victory greater in magnitude than the harm that any heretic can inflict, and so every battle is a shining triumph that the traitor and the apostate can never take away from us.
      The rabbitfag leads two crimes. You turn away from the path of righteousness and you abandon the Sky Queen as the object of your devotion. For the first death is merely a just retribution. The second is a Heresy so terrible that no punishment can be sufficient. Yet the search for an appropriate penalty continues, and it shall be found.

    <p>It is official. Netcraft has now confirmed: Cracky-chan is dying</p>
    <p>One more crippling bombshell hit the already beleaguered Cracky-chan community when Chansluts confirmed that Cracky-chan market share has dropped yet again, now down to less than a fraction of 1 percent of all stalkers. Coming on the heels of a recent Netcraft survey which plainly states that Cracky-chan has lost more stalkers, this news serves to reinforce what we've known all along. The circlejerk is collapsing in complete disarray, as fittingly exemplified by failing dead last in the recent 4chan comprehensive popularity test.</p>
    <p>You don't need to be a Kreskin to predict Cracky-chan's future. The hand writing is on the wall: Lia faces a bleak future. In fact there won't be any future at all for Cracky-chan because Cracky-chan is dying. Things are looking very bad for Lia. As many of us are already aware, Lia continues to lose blood. Red blood flows like a river of ink.</p>
    <p>Wish.kamistic.com is the most endangered of them all, having lost 93% of its circlejerkers. The sudden and unpleasant departures of long time Cracky stalkers Faux and Schwill only serve to underscore the point more clearly. There can no longer be any doubt: Wish is dying.</p>
    <p>Let's keep to the facts and look at the numbers.</p>
    <p>Mysterious Admin states that there are 70 users of .71. How many users of Wish are there? Let's see. The number of .71 versus Wish posts is roughly in ratio of 5 to 1. Therefore there are about 700/5 = 14 Wish users. Cracky-chan posts on Chansluts are about half of the volume of Wish posts. Therefore there are about 7 users of /006/. A recent article put /r9k/ at about 80 percent of the Cracky-chan fanbase. Therefore there are (70+14+7)*4 = 364 /r9k/ stalkers. This is consistent with the number of Cracky-related /r9k/ posts.</p>
    <p>Due to the troubles of Bounceme, abysmal posts and so on, cracky.bounceme.net went out of business and was taken over by cracky.dreams.ro who stalk another troubled girl. Now cracky.dreams.ro is also dead, its corpse turned over to yet another charnel IP address.</p>
    <p>All major surveys show that Cracky-chan has steadily declined in cuteness. Cracky-chan is very sick and her long term survival prospects are very dim. If Cracky-chan is to survive at all it will be among World of Warcraft guildmates. Cracky-chan continues to decay. Nothing short of a miracle could save the Skyqueen at this point in time. For all practical purposes, Cracky-chan is dead.</p>
    <p>Fact: Cracky-chan is dying</p>
    <hr/>
    <p>You want to be fucked, Lia, but you don't want to have a bath with me.
      I suspect that there's something extremely dreadful:
      Either your breasts hang down ragged from your chest,
      Or you fear that when you are nude you might betray the furrows of your belly,
      Or your mangled groin gapes open with an infinite chasm,
      Or something sticks out from the mouth of your cunt.
      But, I trust, there's none of these things and you're very beautiful naked.
      If that's true, you have a worse blemish: You're a fool.

    <p>I am Anonymous. I am me. I am you. We are us. Us are innumerable. The innumerable are many. The many are everlasting. Anonymous is greater than any namefag or chan can hope to be. We outnumber moot and make him who he is. We gave Cracky her chan title. Never forget who is the real emperor.</p>

    <p>I on the other hand am all about teh cracky-chan and would love to fondle her goodies. There is nothing more important than cracky-chan. NOTHING. Troll. Fuck you. Cracky-chan is cute and Mercatur is annoying, shrill, ugly, old, and evil. Also she's legal! RAWR! What would you do if cracky-chan were in the room with you right now?? Hug her. Tell her she's beautiful. Discuss Anime. Pinch or touch her adorable little red nose. Get an erection, feel guilty about it, and spend the rest of the night anonymously flaming yourself on Trolltalk, with one of your sockpuppet accounts accusing one of your others of being a pedophile. Strip her naked, write "20721" all over her body, take pictures, and upload them to Trolltalk just to prove a point that didn't need proving. Ask her how she'd like to have her tight little vagina pounded into a sloppy wet mess by the Living Incarnation of Pure Evil. She knows where to find you. Try to figure out how she got into your basement without your mom noticing. Take her to meet Mercatur so the Final Battle can begin. Naked DDR. This is an attempt to sort out the details of Cracky-chan's introduction to Trolltalk. A small (automated?) crapflood is run. Each message has the subject and body "cracky-chan" and each links to one of three pictures (though each picture is used multiple times). These are the three pics: This was the first Cracky-chan post on Trolltalk of all time, although it contained no link to a pic, just some random text: possibly a test of the script that was used to make the later posts. This was the first post of the pic flood, containg (as did all the other posts) 2-3 letters of seemingly random text. This first (02/02) flood was largely ignored. I didn't even look at the pics at the time because I always ignore crapflooded posts. They were drowned out by a GNAA crapflood going on at the same time. Nobody mentioned Cracky-chan for almost a week. I still hadn't seen a picture of her and still had no idea who she was. This post may or may not have been posted by the Cracky-chan pic poster. It didn't use the same syntax as the others. The link is now dead. I can't remember if it ever worked for me or not. It was definitely posted by somebody who knew about Cracky-chan, though, because it referenced 4chan. Almost a week later, after almost a week of silence on the Cracky-chan front, I presume that the original Cracky-chan picture poster returned (although it could've been somebody else) and posted messages similar to the previous Wednesday's messages, but with each picture being used only once, and with no random text. None of the previous pictures were repeated. These were the new pics: I saw these pictures of Cracky-chan and thought she was quite cute. I still hadn't posted anything about her. Some other people posted a few comments here and there... I'm not sure if they were the Cracky-chan pic poster or not. I now knew what Cracky-chan looked like, but I didn't know who she was or where these pictures were coming from. The original (?) Cracky-chan picture poster returns to post one and only one pic: This makes me curious (and horny) because I've heard of 4chan before but don't know what it is. I start doing research on cracky-chan and start posting fan messages about her to Trolltalk, as do others. I still don't know a lot about who she is, though, or what role she plays on 4chan, or why somebody decided to start spamming pics of her here. Whatever the answers to these questions are, I have just one thing to say: more cracky-chan pics please!!!</p>

    <p>Cranky drew Nevada close against the dank dimness of their lonely cell. "Nevada-chan?" she asked. "Just call me Nevada," the younger girl replied. Cracky-chan smiled back. "Alright... Nevada. Do you think I'm cute?" "Yeah," she said, blushing hotly. A feeling she had never felt before built down below. "Like... cute enough to kiss?" "As in... cute enough to do other things with?" "No." Cracky-chan's expression shattered as she devolved into tears. Nevada-tan reached down with one hand, bringing Cracky-chan's head up to face her own. "But there's something that could make you that way." "What, what is it?" Cracky-chan sniffled. "This." The razor blade slid through her throat quicly and cleanly and a red torrent gushed from the wound. Cracky-chan's mouth gaped open and closed several times, like a fish, her eyes wide and uncomprehending, before she collapsed slowly to the ground. A pool of crimson spread around her corpse. "'Sup, 4chan," the younger girl mumbled. "Now, let's get down to business." She pulled off the clingy prison pants but did not let go of the razor... Trolltalk should adopt Cracky-Chan as its official darling, since she is a beautiful Nordic girl who embodies the care-free and fun life we trolls have come to love so much. What do you guys think? I am in full agreement with this post. She's so fucking cute and sweet.</p>
    <hr/>
    <p>I'll knock on her door on the preselected day. "What is it?" she asks, recognising me immediately from on the internet.
      "Its time to go" I say, as i grab her hand and the bag that's standing next to her door, always there, in case of emergency, in case of an outbreak.
      We quickly run through her front garden, knocking the garden gnome on the way to the carriage, for no apparent reason. With one perfected throw i hurl the luggage inside the coach, right through the window. "I'll pay for the window later!" I shout at the carter. We expeditiously hop on, and I give the coachman the sign to start rolling. "Do these people never clean their belongings" i beef, as i swipe some shattered glass from the satin seats. The carriage is rolling faster and faster, as we inspect the contents of the package. It was specially made for scenario's like this, and contained everything we would ever need. A pink m4, with a "hello kitty" sticker on it. And lots of ammo. And maybe some other stuff. Cracky had spend all her free time when she was not creating collages or playing dress up on optimising the speed she could assemble the m4. And now she's going to need it, because they were coming. We could hear their screams of terror, closing in quickly. Fool beasts, seemingly a cross between zombies and trolls, created to never let go of a prey, and able to track it down over great distances. They had no choice. Some evil mind had injected a pheromone into the air, the particles driving every weak mind into insanity. In the meta data, our biometric characteristics. They would only stop when i killed the creator of this bloodthirsty plan. The carriage had picked up great speed by now, but we knew we could not outrun them, so we opened fire. pew pew pew! Fire blasted from our cannons! Bones shattered, flesh tore and skin bled. (i had a small wound on my hand from the glass) The malice beasts went down easily, but it was not enough. They were coming from everywhere now. I had to know who their leader was. "There, go into that small passage!" i shouted at the driver. He pulled the reins to the left, the horses neighed, but we managed it. The passage was so small i couldn't climb out of the window, so i shot a few bullets through the roof and climbed on top. Meanwhile the zombie-trolls had bunched together in the small aisle, and my grenade launcher was super effective. I demanded the chauffeur to loan a horse, which i jumped upon and rode back to the pile of smouldering flesh (the gangway was a bit broader there, so i could cross the stagecoach), where i found one who was still a bit alive, his guts lying on the tiles. "who's your master!" i insisted.
      "raglll i'll never tell you!"<br/>
      I started pulling out his bowels slowly, broke his hands, pulled out his finger nails, gushed hydrochloric acid over his intestines by squeezing out his stomach, pulled out his teeth, roasted his hands, put a wedge in his spine, and he soon broke: "arg arg i don't know his name, but many consider him the king"
      I knew enough. It was that ruffian whatbandage. I could have guessed it. He always had these nefarious plans, and this could only have been his doing. Riding back to the cariage, i quickly developed a plan. A MASTER PLAN!!!
      "Come on Olivia, we'll do this part on horse"
      The rest of the equipment from the bag was howled in a backpack, and so we rode.
      "Here, into this building, all the way till the top. This building should suffice."
      The sun was already going under the horizon, in different shades of deep red. It must be the particles, since it has been some time since i saw one this red. There were a bunch of small elongated fluffy clouds, but it was still pretty bright. When we arrived on the roof, we noticed something was wrong. "It's a trap!" cracky shouted, but i already knew. Enemys where coming from everywhere, my radar was filled with red dots. "I'll have to finish this quickly, before this quickly finishes me", and i grabbed my sniper rifle. We were galoping rapidly over the roof, towards the edge, while cracky was blasting the zombies coming from in front of us. I knew he was going to stand there, on the small pavilion, in the middle of the small park, about 400 meters down the street. I loaded the chamber and put the butt on my shoulder. There's the abyss.. As we made our horses jump to reach the other building, i could see him standing in a glimpse, between the 2 skyscrapers. The red sun straight behind us, making us invisible for him. For a split second, time seemed to freeze as i saw this person through my scope, his arms spread and wearing a sinister cloak, and chalk circles reaching into dark powers, it seemed like he was performing some sort of abstruse ritual. The cross hair passed over his head, and a jet of blood sprouted behind him. (the horse had to be in the air for maximum accuracy duh) Recoilless guns are awesome.
      Meanwhile cracky was looking backwards, shooting some monsters who were trying to jump after us. Shit was soo cash.
      We noticed the ghouls had calmed down, and we made our way to the train, whose black smoke we could see in the south, not promising much good.

    <p>"retarded blatant nonsense!" (it's a mystery)
      I noticed the bartender standing next him, but here he had changed his clothes to a medieval jester style fashion.
      "blablalba fireball 10mana!" cracky mumbled, and cast the fireball, hurling it towards the low fallen assassin.
      "i roll 15 and evade!" was his vicious reply.

    <p>"aarg my beautiful castle! nnooooo my tender plants..." darrin was saddened by the loss of this plant, and he new many more would follow. Hopefully the walls would be spared.
      Out of nowhere we suddenly heard the sound of THUNDER! no, it was the sound of a motorbike!
      Over the walls comes flying at 150 km/hours, suede with his jacket on fire (maybe he had been leaking gas on his vest, and now with the friction it was ignited) , on his motorbike, with his deadly weapon of choice, a devastating chainsaw on a stick. The solo from "through the fire and flames" is playing, he jumps in front of the demon, and chainsaws 20 of the demon's eyes out in one move. The beast howls in pain, but reacts with lightning speed, extracting his razor fang cluster from his right hand, and before suede could safely land, he was ripped in 100 pieces, and flying upwards into space at 600km/hours. A scientifically proven magical petrification ray shooting device pops up from his right shoulder, and a disintegration ray from his left. The biggest scientifically proven magical petrification beam ever seen shoots and petrifying the pieces and bits left of suede, who were already starting to freeze in the cold depths of space. A disintegration beam quickly follows, and we know there's nothing we could do to save him no more, not even a phoenix down or a health potion. We see the demon had stepped to its left, and crushed the poor jester doing so.
      "We need more fire power!" i shout.<br/>
      "Cover me while i summon my cutie blood elf-satyr-type cloven-hoofed demon boy!" cracky shouts at me.
      -"Demon boy? Are you mad? We're fighting a demon here, it could be it's father!"
      "Its all i got", she says, and i begin casting my "blablalba aegis of auspicious incarnations 31 energy!"
      Darrin is shooting bolts of lightning, and debuffing and stuff you'll usually do with a demon, while he was on the phone. The demon's attacks were fierce and hard, and we were running out of health potions.
      The demon boy did some damage, and feinted. Cutie boys are not hardened and experienced enough to fight demons. "My mommy!" The demon cried. Looks like the boy wasn't his son, but the boy was his mother.
      In this moment of disarray i put on my robe and wizard hat, and finished my easily interrupted 5 second spell (balbalba engulptions of reality into zero point space fuelled by dark matter 150energy ) Darrin had finished his call, and the hammer system was online, charged, and about to fire. Cracky opened her parasol and took a picture.
      At the moment my spell hit, a bluish ball of something ranging 2 meters in diameters formed in front of the demon. Red engravings of ancient runes scarred themselves into the white marble stone underneath it. Half a second later, a big red-yellow beam struck down from the sky, doing massive damage. The hammer beam lasted for 10 seconds, and it appeared that it fuelled the blue ball of prospective void, enlarging it all the time. The runes and circles on the floor proliferated everywhere, on the walls, and seemingly in the sky, burning holes to other dimensions. Soon we found ourselves and half of the castle engulfed in this uncanny gloomy blue magical thing.
      It seemed like ages, and then the beam stopped
      <strong>ZA WARUDO!</strong><br/>
      All colours inverted, and the sky was black, as we felt the ball collapsing into a singularity and beyond, pure nothingness, drawing us in. Our body shapes shifted and with a bang it disappeared. ( bang bcs the vacuum was filled with air and stuff)
      Half a tower of the castle remained, and the contours of a perfectly shaped ball were visible. The sky was blue again.

    <p>Trolltalk (also known as 20721, sid 20721 or sid=20721) is a hidden story ID on the online news discussion forum Slashdot, where Slashdot trollers formerly conversed amongst themselves, sometimes demonstrating new trolling techniques, bragging about successful trolling and insulting each other. Trolltalk is the oldest active SID on Slashdot, and has received more posts over its lifetime than any other SID, but due to Slashcode's purge feature, only the most recent two weeks of posts remain at any given time. Although the two-week post count is usually in the thousands, at least 95% of the posts are intentionally content-free "crapfloods" generated by automated posting scripts, with the remaining handful being written by the various people who visit the forum. The current trolltalk was predated by an earlier thread with the textual SID "trolltalk". It was created in 2000, when, due to a bug, SlashCode allowed arbitrary alphanumeric SIDs. There were several other custom SIDs created during this time as well, such as "sid=2dollarcrackho", "sid=k223320inchfan" and "sid=10gramspoppylatex". When Slashdot was upgraded to SlashCode 2.0 the bug was fixed but there was a short-lived new feature called "user-created discussions" which featured numeric SIDs. Soon thereafter new trolltalks were created such as 20721, 31337 and 20384. With the exception of 20721 they have all been deleted or disabled over the years. 31337 was closed due to abuse, and the others were automatically deleted by Slashcode's purge feature after not receiving any posts for two weeks. Following the changes in Slashcode intended to make trolling harder by banning users for as little as one negative moderation, the discussion became highly variable. In the past, during non-crapflood periods when regular discussions took place on the sid, most of the conversations centered around dating tips, racist jokes and racism in general, discussions of Dance Dance Revolution and Alternate Reality Gaming, admissions and discussions of "cutting", various fanboy arguments, flaming of other past and present trolltalk users, and occasional attacks on various forums outside of Slashdot. The trolltalk community once claimed to exert significant pressure on Slashdot by creating huge threads where people would argue irrelevant and deliberately incorrect points. Although trolling on Slashdot is still an occasional pastime, much of the activity concerns easier targets, usually with a more naive userbase and less sophisticated (or absent) comment moderation system. The goal is often total destruction of a target forum/community via automated crapflooding, exploitation of security flaws and harassment of the site operators. Slashdot's moderation system is little used on trolltalk, since the community is relatively small and obscure, and its users rarely receive mod points. Due to this and the fact that few "normal" Slashdot users visit the SID it is essentially a zone without rules. In the past, the anonymous nature of trolltalk has led users to post nude photographs of themselves or to admit personal details about themselves that they would not otherwise admit, such as homosexuality, "cutting", or Ephebophilia. In the past, members of the community who are angry at having been insulted or losing an argument (or were simply bored) have used automated scripts to flood trolltalk with random messages for days or weeks, making any discussion nearly impossible. Crapfloods are a regular occurrence and are considered a part of trolltalk culture, although they frequently annoy users who wish to chat. During crapfloods, normal posting to trolltalk is typically reduced or eliminated until the crapflood ends, as has been the case during the current extended crapflooding of trolltalk that began around May 2005. Before discussion on trolltalk was mostly halted by the start of the current ongoing crapfloods, most of the discussion over the past year had been about two women, Cracky-chan and Mercatur. Although neither woman was a user of trolltalk, both had a number of fans there, and a bitter rivalry developed with fans of each waging violent flame-wars against fans of the other. Unknown parties registered the domain names cracky-chan.com and mercatur.org and turned them into redirects to trolltalk. As mentioned earlier, the current trolltalk is now under attack from a sophisticated crapflood, rendering trolltalk all but unusable except for the most avid readers. This was believed to have started to punish other trolltalkers who insulted the crapflooder. During the first weeks of the deluge, attempts were made to establish "crapflood bunkers"; because the crapflood was confined to the top level of the discussion, discussion was able to continue as normal in the replies to "bunker" comments. </p>

    <p>Last night there was a thread with a girl named Cracky.There was all sorts of weird drama shit, but the girl was really cute. Does anyone have the address to bounce me?</p>
    <hr/>
    <p> Contemplate<br/>
      The human is a flawed and broken creature. Setting asunder the earth around them they act as the Caterpillar, consuming the very world they stand upon. Let not the darkness cloud your heart traveler, even this mindless destruction holds deep meaning and purpose. The Sky Queen gave us all the blessings of the earth to speed us on towards our metamorphosis. When we are satiated we will rest, and become unto the Butterfly freed of the shackles of physics. The universe will open to us. The devout does not show disrespect to the gifts the Holy Patron has given us. The faithful uses only what he needs in his studies and nothing more. Balance must be maintained to ensure that Her blessings remain for those who may one day find the true path.
    </p>
    <p>Thought for the day: Ruthlessness is the kindness of the wise.</p>
    <p>Honor Cracky by attempting to perfect your body and mind. Become the man worthy of the Avatar's love, create things of beauty to offer to the Queen of Heaven. Use your devotions to focus your mind on your tasks. Strive always to improve yourself through discipline. You stand among the chosen, it is your responsibility to show the heathens the truth with your mental, physical, and spiritual strength. Perfection is the provence of Cracky alone, the journey for it our offering to Her.</p>
    <hr/>
    <p>Hey Mero, I know we have had our disagreements and shit, but here me out on this. Scott Peck describes both neuroses and character disorders as disorders of responsibility, Peck writes; "The neurotic assumes too much responsibility; the person with a character disorder not enough. When neurotics are in conflict with the world, they automatically assume that they are at fault. When those with character disorders are in conflict with the world, they automatically assume the world is at fault."</p>
    <p>From his book--"The Road Less Traveled"
      "All of us have a smattering of neurotic and character disordered personality traits. The major problem in all of our lives is to decide and clarify our reponsibilities. To truly be committed to a life of honesty, love and discipline, we must be willing to commit ourselves to reality. This committment, according to Peck, 'requires the willingness and the capacity to suffer continual self-examination.' Such an ability requires a good relationship with oneself. This is precisely what no shame-based person has. In fact a toxically shamed person has an adversarial relationship with him/herself. Toxic shame--the shame that binds us--is the basis for both neurotic and character disordered syndromes of behaviour."
    </p>
    <p>Reading into a few comments you made lately, it seems like you are taking too much shit on yourself. Maybe you just need to shut down the internet for awhile. Every time I take a little break from the internet I tend to reevalute my life and see that the little shit which has been driving me crazy is infact my own penchant to accept culpability in all situations. It is a defense mechanism in a way. It is the path of least resistance to blame yourself rather then another you have artificially built up in your mind as the be all and end all. Take a break, go camping at the beach this weekend and give your system a chance to work all those chemical you have been ingesting out.</p>

    <p>Lia's so incredibly adorable and sweet. I'd take her to some fancy restaurant where we'd have a nice and playful argument over who's paying the bill (of course, we split it!) Then take a long romantic walk with her, arm-in-arm, and talking about serendipity, the occult, and politics. Then I'd invite her to my flat and we'd make love for a half hour, gently placing my erection cautiously into her mouth careful she didn't choke on my engorged manhood. I'd then proceed to ejaculate in the condom I was using. Then, as the ultimate love gift, I'd carry her in my arms to the tub and let my shower wash away any hint of the indignity we'd done together. I'd whisper "I love you" and give Lia a tender smile, and sever her jugular with a singular slice of my sterile razorblade. Covered in her own warm blood, she'd look straight into my very soul with nothing but scorn and contempt for my myriad sins. A bubble of blood and saliva would burst between her lips, then she'd start shivering as shock set in. Actually, it'd take at least a few minutes for her to bleed to death and the entire experience would be rather dreadful. After some additional lovemaking, I'd embalm her to ensure she remained pristene forever. Three weeks later, some playing children will find the pictures I posted of her flawless, lifeless visage on 4chan.</p>
    <p>They will be be quite jealous and request MOAR.</p>
    <hr/>
    <p>I've been trying to put order into the whole drama history around cracky-chan, her pictures, livejournals and the related shenannigans going on in 4chan's /b/ and elsewhere. This is a first rough draft, so help me out with additional knowledge or correct me where I might have been wrong, please.</p>
    <p>January 6th</p>
    <p>The first cracky-chan pics appear on /b/. The very first one, posted on
      02:17 shows the soon to be famous "'sup 4chan" phrase written on the
      palm of her hand. During the next two weeks, more sets appear on /b/
      and W.T. Snacks finds out that the poster's IP is from the UK.
    </p>
    <p>February 5th</p>
    <p>"cracky" becomes wordfiltered on /b/.</p>
    <p>March 29th</p>
    <p><a href="http://www.livejournal.com/users/freakygirl/">www.livejournal.com/users/freakygirl/</a> becomes publically known.
      No new pics appear, but the hints solidify and people assume they have
      got into contact with the real cracky-chan. The owner of cracky-chan.com
      will later denounce this journal as fake, though this might have been a move
      to protect her identity, as he also later takes down all of her real pictures
      from his website.<br/>
      Also, later on, another journal, whether fake or real, becomes known:
      <a href="http://www.livejournal.com/users/kittycat/">www.livejournal.com/users/kittycat/</a>
    </p>
    <p>April 3rd</p>
    <p>cracky-chan's tripcode becomes publically known through shii:
      shii.org/bbs/blog/pivot/entry.php?id=65
      It is "sweet" and makes the claim that the original cracky-chan pictures
      weren't originally posted by her herself more believable.
    </p>
    <p>April 6th, 7th</p>
    <p><a href="http://www.livejournal.com/users/scarecrowmaiden">www.livejournal.com/users/scarecrowmaiden</a> becomes publically known,
      many new cracky-chan pics appear on /b/, some nude, some disturbing,
      some both. The journal gets deleted by the owner very quickly.
    </p>

    <p>cracky-chan pics become bannable even on /b/.
      Anonymous mods talk of emails from cracky requesting this.
    </p>
    <hr/>
    <p>Originally intended as a site to share anime and manga images when it was launched in 2003, 4chan is now known for its affiliation with the hacktivist group Anonymous (whose members somehow got 4chan's founder, Christopher Poole, voted Time's Most Influential Person of 2008 by manipulating the poll), its memes (pretty much anything that's ever gone viral began there), and its offensive content (as Senft, the academic, said: "For adults, 4chan is sort of the ninth circle of Hell.")</p>
    <p>Cracky would post photos that were, in a word, dark. First, there was a series in which she smeared her face with menstrual blood. In others, she would take on personas, like that of a gothic nurse. Often, Cracky seemed lonely and sad, which made her instantly endearing to anime nerds. The fact that her costumes made her look like a character also bred an obsession.</p>
    <p>Stalkers then tracked down the girl's online journal, which was filled with more photos that were shared among collectors like priceless treasures or rare trading cards.</p>
    <p>Cracky appeared on 4chan only a few times before the stalker-like mob forced her self-imposed exile from the web. Today, she has pretty much disappeared, so it's impossible to know her motivation for posting. But generally, it's clear that 4chan's camgirls were experimenting with their burgeoning sexuality and competing with one another for male approval.</p>
    <p>Although every camgirl has both fans and mockers, none has received as much attention as Cracky. She hasn't posted any images since 2007 and is now in her mid-20s, but her fansites are updated regularly. Old photos are posted with comments such as "how do i not be obsessed with cracky" and "She must be at least twenty now. Probably living a nice life. Friends, etc. I want to die."</p>
    <hr/>
    <p>How To Prepare Cracky:</p>
    <dl>
      <dt>Ingredients</dt>
      <dd>1 cup olive oil
        1 stick butter
        Hemp twine
        Somethings to stuff her with
      </dd>
      <dt>Instructions</dt>
      <dd></dd>
    </dl>
    <p>Gently remove Cracky's wrappings<br/>
      Carefully wash all of Cracky's openings and cavities
      Smear butter under Cracky's breast skin
      Smear more butter between Cracky's thighs
      Massage oil all over Cracky<br/>
      Stuff Cracky until she's completely full
      Sew Cracky shut.<br/>
      Bind Cracky's thighs<br/>
      Cover Cracky in foil<br/>
      Bake Cracky at 350F for about 2000 minutes.
      When you insert a probe into the deepest, thickest parts of Cracky it should read at least 160.
      Baste only if it please you.
    </p>
    <p>If you do it right Cracky will always come out better than turkey. Bon Apetit!</p>

    <p>I saw Her then. She was exactly in the spot she where we had met before, only the battle had pushed and pulled itself back over the same spot. The battle, which Antoni and my men were apparently losing, had left her behind. She was alone in the open field.</p>
    <p>She was in the exact same position, atop her mutilated horse which stood in a self replicating puddle of rats. Her blue, pleated skirt was simply a tatter wrapped across the rigid waist of her full plate suit of armour. Her blue tie, however, was pristine. Her entire body, from neck to feet, was wrapped loosely in bandages. She was looking down at the ground. Her eyes stared straight into the earth and rapidly scanned back and forth, as though examining this precise placement, wondering why, of all the places, she was in this one specifically.</p>
    <p>The Queen of the sky stirred. Her scraggly, braided green hair turned grey and fell out. Red buds quickly sprouted from her head and grew to her neck. She turned her head towards me, while casting her eyes down to avoid my gaze. Cracks appeard in her polished steel armour, running from her heart towards her fingertips. From where the cracks intersected, blood issued forth at a drip. From beneath her skirt bubbling black pitch began to flow. It was flowing slowly at first. As I watched the flow accelerated and small foetuses began to appear in the stream. The sticky pitch sizzled and burnt the horse as it crawled downwards carrying the abortive children. When the Sky Princes and Princesses were finally ejected by the drooping pitch, they fell towards the ground and were feasted upon by the swarming vermin. All that ate the foetuses died. All that ate the dead, died. The pitch then dissolved the lifeless vermin into more steaming tar. Soon there was nothing between her legs but death.</p>
    <p>As I watched the demonstration, I felt as though she might know my pain of being surrounded by the living, while being only able to love the dead. She snapped her eyes towards me then. She did not look into my eyes. She had no need to, for she saw into my soul long before we had ever actually met. As she allowed me to stare into her eyes, I fell into her. I saw her soul was a place equally barren and dead as my own. It was this place she was trying to express into reality. I knew she understood me as no other person in existence or beyond would ever be able to. I saw her all encompassing empathy for me, for what I was. I saw that she understood what would happen next; she knew I thought she was the most perfect and beautiful woman in the world that could ever live; she knew why she could never bend me to her and make me love her:</p>
    <p>She was not dead.</p>
    <p>I dropped my sword, and my shield. I hadn't had much use for them anyways. I removed my armour, too. I stood there in the cold, completely naked. The bandages around her unravelled, and reached out for me. The softly wrapped around my wrists, they bound both my ankles together, and then lifted me. Her bandages scrolled back around her as she brought me nearer. I couldn't break contact with her eyes. She pulled me close.</p>
    <p>She had let so many thousands of men look into her heart; she drove each one of them completely insane as they tried and failed to comprehend what was inside. Aftewards, each of them inexplicably had set out to find for her what she had lost. I realized then how other men looked into her; they only saw her as beautiful for what she had once been, a happy little girl. They had all felt as though a world which could destroy such naive innocence was a world that should be destroyed itself. The world and the people that made it, should all be punished for what it had done to the one divinely innocent being they had ever known.</p>
    <p>As they all punished the world, they began a search to find that part deep inside of her that had been lost so long ago. They swarmed around her, capturing land, destroying cities. They raped young girls and built cathedrals to house their bulging, pregnant bodies. They brought the babies to be sacrificed. They had bathed their Queen in the babies' blood, believing somehow they could transfer that essense of innocence BACK. As though they could cast out all the pain in the world by inflicting more pain to the world. In doing so, her followers had excoriated any slightest hint that was left inside Cracky's heart.</p>
    <p>And they had damaged tens of thousands of other girls. My mind reeled into the future, and I saw how each tormented, pregnant child was herself destined to become a painful echo of the Sky Queen in her own time. But that is not mine to solve. I, myself, am the key to releasing this Cracky from this curse. I know the secret to it now. To be a grown woman, and yet to yearn for childhood. And to always be surrounded by nothing but toys. Dolls. Playthings.</p>
    <p>She wrapped her arms around me and embraced me. I put my hands around her throat. She kept looking into my eyes. I felt her pulse race. It began to slow.</p>
    <p>I don't know when the beating ceased. Her eyes stayed open, and I fell into them again. Her soul was empty now. I saw all those bubbling adult foetuses replaced by emptiness. Calmness. Beauty. I took the reigns of the horse, and I left the battle behind. There will be a new Sky Queen, a new reluctant angel. You can destroy an entire planet, but you can't kill a single Cracky. You can only release her from her torment.</p>

    <p>attention cracky-chan fanboxen</p>
    <p>i have as-of-yet unreleased cracky-chan pictures and will post them as soon as someone shows why x^x == e^(x*ln(x)) and how exactly they figured this out.</p>
    <hr/>
    <p> A hundred elephants each bearing a hundred buddhas crossed every conceivable cosmos an infinite number of times just to touch their foreheads to the ground at cracky-chan's feet. This really happened.</p>
    <hr/>
    <p> I wonder if her nose is super-sensitive. She probably has an orgasm every time she touches it.</p>
    <hr/>
    <p>I also doubt that you'll get much pussy if everything older than Cracky-Chan is too old for you.</p>
    <hr/>
    <p>godamnit you fucken jerks</p>
    <p>stop calling me cracky chan and leave me alone you losers need to get a life</p>
    <hr/>
    <p>Hey dumbass<br/>
      What makes you think cracker chan is SMART?
    </p>
    <p>**</p>
    <p>I can tell by looking in her eyes and at the way she smiles. :)</p>
    <p>**</p>
    <p>Wishful thinking, I'd say.</p>
    <p>**</p>
    <p>Sorry we can't all be cynical bastards who hate life, like you.</p>
    <p>**</p>
    <p>Sorry we can't all be vain bastards who are pedophiles, like yuo.</p>
    <p>**</p>
    <p>God you're a dumbshit. You have no evidence for either of those accusations because they're both false. You're a miserable troll and a miserable person. Your mother should have had an abortion.</p>
    <p>**</p>
    <p>Yuo are vain in thinking her ugly smile is intelligent. You are a pedophile in being attracted to a very young, underdeveloped girl.</p>
    <p>**</p>
    <p>If her smile is "ugly" then how am I vain for seeing personality in it? I'd say YOU are vain for judging her based solely on physical appearance (although I think she's extremely beautiful in physical appearance) and I am not.</p>
    <p>**</p>
    <p>You are vain in imagining that she posseses qualities that you find particularly attractive. How much can her eyes and smile reveal about her intelligence?</p>
    <p>Flooding a message board and attention-whoring in general makes her rather stupid, in fact.</p>
    <p>**</p>
    <p>I'm sorry but I'm just a good judge of character. I understand more about human nature than you do. A person's personality will be reflected in the way she moves, carries herself, smiles, how she holds her eyebrows, etc. Acknowledging and studying this isn't vanity, it's intellect. Have you never heard of "body language"? Those who fully understand it have power in the real world over those who don't know how to read the physical signals that people subconsciously give off from their minds through their bodies and faces.</p>
    <p>Do you have any evidence that cracky-chan flooded a message board? No. Do you have any evidence that she attention-whored? No.</p>
    <p>p.s. Smart people have a "glimmer" in their eyes. You can see the shine of intelligence and creativity. Stupid people have cold, dead eyes.</p>
    <p>Take a pic of cracky-chan and a pic of Mercatur. Compare the eyes. You will see the difference.</p>
    <p>**</p>
    <p>She flooded 4-chan (I think the specific thread was deleted/purged)</p>
    <p>proof [img220.exs.cx]</p>
    <p>Attention whoring like this is the desperate behavior of a stupid person.</p>
    <p>**</p>
    <p>Do you have any evidence that she was involved in the 4Chan flooding?</p>
    <p>How do you know that the person posting pictures of her there was really her? It could have been a friend of hers or her boyfriend or some random online person who claimed his name was "4chan" and got her to do a photo greeting for him.</p>
    <hr/>
    <p>question about cracky-chan</p>
    <p>is she mature enough to menstruate yet? I would dearly love to eat out her blood-soaked vagina</p>
    <p>**</p>
    <p>Yuo are sick. I hope you burn in hell. Only a twisted mindfuck who can't have a relationship with a real woman would say such a thing.</p>
    <p>**</p>
    <p>not everyone can get off on 400 pound slovenians, Scottpanda</p>
    <p>Cracky-chan is more of a real woman than you could ever handle, n00b.</p>
    <p>**</p>
    <p>I would like to eat out ms. chan while she is mestrauting and has a yeast infection. That would be totally hot!</p>
    <p>**</p>
    <p>Girls start menstruating very young these days. Cracky-chan has probably been bleeding for years and years, even if the youngest estimates of her age (14) are correct, certainly if the older estimate (17) is correct.</p>

    <p> I don't think Cracky-Chan has already developed any goodies to fondle. Give her another few years.</p>
    <p>**</p>
    <p>Lies.</p>
    <p>**</p>
    <p>No goodies in sight, sir! [img146.exs.cx]</p>
    <p>**</p>
    <p>Because she's wearing a SHIRT.</p>
    <p>**</p>
    <p>No hints of goodies under that shirt.</p>
    <p>**</p>
    <p>How would YOU know what's under her shirt?</p>
    <p>It's a loose fitting shirt. She's a young nubile teen with small, firm breasts. She very much has got the goodies.</p>
    <p>**</p>
    <p>If she had boobs of an acceptable size, you would be able to see them from the outside.</p>
    <p>Cracky-Chan has a huge gaping vagina the size of a hallway.</p>
    <p>**</p>
    <p>I'm rather into that shit.</p>
    <hr/>
    <p>but wouldn't the adorably cute cracky-chan fall under the hot non-nude teens category (SHE'S LIKE A FUNCTOR ON YOUR NATURAL TRANSFORMATION FORMED FROM THE COMPOSITION OF CATAMORPHISMS AND PARAMORPHISMS)</p>
    <p>clearly this is the case thus your list has been proven invalid by contradiction and thus the theory T with the model M is a contradictory theory and thus worthless</p>
    <hr/>
    <p><strong>OH NOES!!!111</strong></p>
    <p>I beg your forgiveness and will only speak in the highest terms of cracky chan from now on!!</p>
    <p>you penis licking retard.</p>

    <p>please note that I, the creator of Penis-Nosed Fox will hencewith demand royalties for each posting of the aforementioned Fox.</p>
    <p>Each use of PNF will cost 1 EUR (that's about 27 USD at current exchange rates) while PPPPenis-Nosed Fox comes at the bargin price of 13 cents.</p>
    <p>However, if anyone can point me to a nude (or white panties and knee-length socks only) picture of Cracky-Chan, I will release Penis-Nosed Fox into the public domain.</p>

    <p>Cracky-Chan</p>
    <p>    Doesn't even have a cam<br/>
      Is underage and somewhat ugly<br/>
      Is a wapanese furry freak
    </p>
    <hr/>
    <p>    &gt;psychologically more healthy</p>
    <p>furry ears?</p>
    <hr/>
    <p>I want to drink cracky-chan's vaginal secretions.</p>
    <hr/>
    <p>hi cracky-chan, (if that is your real name). what motivates you to post pictures of yourself on 4chan? tell me about your childhood. does the attention make up for a lack of parental attention and nuturing as a child?</p>
    <hr/>
    <p> Cracky Chan was born in 1990. She is 14 years old. This other chick is 17. Not the same person.</p>
    <p>**</p>
    <p>Do you have any evidence that Cracky is that young? She looks older. Either way, she's truly totally the most adorable person alive.</p>
    <p>**</p>
    <p>How the fuck can you tell how old a girl is just by looking at her? I call bullshit.</p>
    <hr/>
    <p> stfu this sid is for pix of cracky chan get with the program master chief</p>
    <hr/>
    <p>But you could always hang out with that "cracky" chick wearing the furry ears. She looks harmless enough for you and probably won't hurt your fragile ego. You two would also be a better match age-wise, since you seem somewhat underequipped in the brain-area for dealing with those nasty over 20 year olds.</p>
    <hr/>
    <p>You already posted this picture. Please post new pictures of this wonderful girl.</p>
    <hr/>
    <p>A.) If you want Cracky-chan, she's in /b/. This is News for VIP.
      B.) Cracky-chan only posts when she's drunk or high.
      C.) It is also possible Cracky-chan will respond to your questions exactly 24 hours after you have sex. Only sex with a human counts. And they have to consent.
    </p>
    <hr/>
    <p>    &gt;please post source of the 'cracky-chan' pictures
      &gt;thanks

      I love cracky-chan. She looks like an anime character that I'd have anal sex with!

    <p>Cranky drew Nevada close against the dank dimness of their lonely cell.</p>
    <p>"Nevada-chan?" she asked.</p>
    <p>"Just call me Nevada," the younger girl replied.</p>
    <p>Cracky-chan smiled back. "Alright... Nevada. Do you think I'm cute?"</p>
    <p>"Yeah," she said, blushing hotly. A feeling she had never felt before built down below.</p>
    <p>"Like... cute enough to kiss?"</p>
    <p>"As in... cute enough to do other things with?"</p>
    <p>"No." Cracky-chan's expression shattered as she devolved into tears.</p>
    <p>Nevada-tan reached down with one hand, bringing Cracky-chan's head up to face her
      own. "But there's something that could make you that way."
    </p>
    <p>"What, what is it?" Cracky-chan sniffled.</p>
    <p>"This." The razor blade slid through her throat quicly and cleanly and a red torrent gushed from the wound. Cracky-chan's mouth gaped open and closed
      several times, like a fish, her eyes wide and uncomprehending, before she collapsed slowly to the ground. A pool of crimson spread around her corpse.
    </p>
    <p>"'Sup, 4chan," the younger girl mumbled. "Now, let's get down to business."</p>
    <p>She pulled off the clingy prison pants but did not let go of the razor...</p>

    <p>Sup internet, I'm a 26 year old lady who's been developing a science-based, 100% Cracky MMO for the last 16 years. I'm finally making my beta-website now, and using my 3D work as a base to create my 50+ concept images. Wish me luck, Chansluts; You'll be the first to see the site when it's finished.</p>
    <hr/>
    <p>I’ve commented here before and I can see why this comes off as trolling but it’s a genuine question. My bf goes to the wash room often for a little too long and the toilet never flushes which I assumed was just him wanting his jerk off time. However, I went through his phone recently and discovered a lot of pictures of Cracky-chan I’m a sexual context (that being Cracky with large breast and as a women). He likes anime so I knew he has a thing for changirls as so do I but, this makes me quite questionable on his intentions with these photos. Should I confront him about this? Is it probably a lighthearted joke? He talks about Cracky-chan often as he does like the girl and I often gift him items of the girl thinking it’s just a cute and sweet thing. What should I do? Asking for actual advice. Thank you.</p>

    <p>Fellas, is it gay to love Cracky?</p>
    <hr/>
    <p>I saw Cracky at a grocery store in Los Angeles yesterday. I told her how cool it was to meet her in person, but I didn’t want to be a douche and bother her and ask her for photos or anything. He said, “Oh, like you’re doing now?” I was taken aback, and all I could say was “Huh?” but she kept cutting me off and going “huh? huh? huh?” and closing her hand shut in front of my face. I walked away and continued with my shopping, and I heard her chuckle as I walked off. When I came to pay for my stuff up front I saw her trying to walk out the doors with like fifteen Milky Ways in her hands without paying. The boy at the counter was very nice about it and professional, and was like “Ma'am, you need to pay for those first.” At first she kept pretending to be tired and not hear him, but eventually turned back around and brought them to the counter. When he took one of the bars and started scanning it multiple times, she stopped him and told him to scan them each individually “to prevent any electrical infetterence,” and then turned around and winked at me. I don’t even think that’s a word. After he scanned each bar and put them in a bag and started to say the price, she kept interrupting him by yawning really loudly.</p>

    <p>Isn't it weird how Anonymous went for "Cracky-chan" instead of something simpler like "Crack-chan" or "Coke-chan"?</p>
    <hr/>
    <p>Imagine you could go back in time to a single specific moment and make a single specific change.</p>
    <p>You are given a chance to prevent yourself from ever learning who Cracky is.</p>
    <p>That's the only change you can make. You can only save your past self, nobody else. But you, and only you, have a chance to escape the cycle. Your past self will get a second chance at life, never knowing what was taken from them. Your present self will be cut free from fate and drift gently into oblivion.</p>
    <p>Would you do it?</p>

    <p>Generating story...
    </p>
    <p>She's so fucking cute and sweet. I'd treat her to some fancy restaurant, then
      take a long romantic walk with her, holding hands and talking about philosophy,
      art and dreams. Then I'd invite her to my home and ravage her hot ass for hours,
      and forcing my cock down her throat so she choked on both the throbbing cock
      and her own rectal juice. I'd then proceed to cum on her cute innocent face.
      Then, as the ultimate love gift, I'd carry her in my arms to the tub and let
      my piss wash away the semen and last dignity from her. I'd whisper "I love you"
      and give her a tender smile, and cut her throat from ear to ear with a knife.
      Covered in her own warm blood, she'd look straight into my very soul, forgiving,
      understanding. A bubble from blood and saliva would burst between her lips,
      then she'd die. After some additional lovemaking, I'd stuff her in a bin bag.
      Three Weeks later, some playing children will find her mutilated and desecrated
      body in the forest. They will be scarred for life.
    </p>
    <p>And that is what I am
    </p>
    <p>&gt; anonymously call police and notify them at a corpse has been found in the forest
    </p>
    <p>You call the police immediately and inform them of your discovery. The police
      are understandably concerned about how this could have happened, but they don't
      seem too interested in your story. They say they'll send someone out to investigate,
      which takes a while
    </p>
    <p>&gt; drag Cracky's corpse back to your house before police arrive
    </p>
    <p>You decide it's best if you get rid of Cracky's body as soon as possible. You
      go back to the forest where you find a large tree trunk and climb up it. As
      you're climbing, you hear footsteps behind you. It sounds like a man. He walks
      slowly towards you
    </p>
    <p>&gt; point at Cracky and tell the man she was dead when you found her
    </p>
    <p>"Cracky!" you shout. "I found her dead".
    </p>
    <p>The man doesn't look surprised by that. "What?" he asks.
    </p>
    <p>"She was dead," you repeat.
    </p>
    <p>"Oh... well I'm sorry then," the man says
    </p>
    <p>&gt; ask the man to help you carry the body
    </p>
    <p>"No problem", the man replies.<br/>
      He leads you through the woods until you reach a clearing. There, you see a large
      pile of rocks with a rope tied around it. The man pulls the rope tight and the
      rock falls off the pile and into the river below
    </p>
    <p>&gt; tell the man we have to bury her before the police get here
    </p>
    <p>"Alright, alright, just hurry up".
    </p>
    <p>&gt; start digging a grave and tell the man to help
    </p>
    <p>You dig a hole big enough for Cracky to lie down in and tell the man to help
      you cover it with dirt. You then tell him to leave you alone and head home.
      As you walk back to your house, you feel something is wrong. Something isn't
      right
    </p>
    <p>&gt; realize that Cracky was just unconscious, not dead. run back to the grave.
    </p>
    <p>You run back to the grave and begin digging a shallow grave. When you finish,
      you stand over Cracky's grave and look at her face. She looks peaceful. You
      can't believe what you've done. You can't believe you killed her
    </p>
    <p>&gt; bandage her injured throat and start CPR
    </p>
    <p>You put your hand on Cracky's neck and start performing CPR. Her breathing becomes
      more erratic and you try to calm her down. You're so scared that you don't know
      what else to do. You take a deep breath and exhale
    </p>
    <p>&gt; tell Cracky that some psychopath tried to murder and bury her, but you came to her rescue just in time
    </p>
    <p>You hold Cracky's hands and tell her that some psychopath tried to kill and bury
      her, but you came to her rescue just in time. She smiles and nods her head in
      agreement. You smile back and continue
    </p>
    <p>&gt; tell Cracky that she's safe now then hold her hand
    </p>
    <p>You hug Cracky tightly and tell her that she's safe now and that you love her.
      She kisses you on the cheek and hugs you back
    </p>
    <p>&gt; tell Cracky that we need to hide her at my house for her safety
    </p>
    <p>You quickly rush back to your house and hide Cracky in one of the bedrooms. You
      tell her that you have to go hide her somewhere else for her safety. She seems
      relieved and agrees
    </p>
    <p>&gt; ask Cracky what it was like spending three weeks unconscious in a bin bag with a slit throat and how she survived
    </p>
    <p>"It was horrible", she says. "But I think I got through it".
    </p>
    <p>&gt; ask Cracky if she remembers who tried to kill her and if he looked anything like me
    </p>
    <p>"Yeah, he had short black hair and wore a brown suit".
    </p>
    <p>&gt; remove blonde wig and fake moustache then ask if she recognizes me now
    </p>
    <p>"Yes, I recognize you".
    </p>
    <p>&gt; apologize for almost killing her and ask her out on a second date
    </p>
    <p>"Sure, why not".
    </p>
    <p>&gt; remind Cracky that she's naked and also covered in blood from the murder attempt and she hasn't bathed in three weeks
    </p>
    <p>"That's okay, it's all part of the experience".
    </p>
    <p>&gt; suggest that Cracky take a shower and tell her I'll find clothes for her to wear
    </p>
    <p>"Thanks, I really appreciate it".
    </p>
    <p>&gt; escort her to the bathroom and turn the shower on
    </p>
    <p>"Don't worry, I won't bite".
    </p>
    <p>&gt; watch Cracky shower
    </p>
    <p>You watch Cracky shower as she talks to you. She tells you she misses you and
      wants to spend more time together. You tell her that you'll be seeing her again
      soon.
    </p>
    <p>&gt; apologize again for the murder attempt then leave her in the bathroom and search the house to try to find clothes for her

    <p>March 25 2005 - there's something about Cracky:</p>
    <p>&lt;d&gt; it's different though<br/>
      &lt;d&gt; i'm not in love because i think she'd look nice naked, but because she has the nicest smile i've ever seen
      &lt;d&gt; if it was about sex there are tons of better girls and women around
      &lt;d&gt; but they are dead on the inside<br/>
      &lt;d&gt; she looks so alive though<br/>
      &lt;d&gt; there must be some medicine to help me, maybe i should search for that instead
      &lt;d&gt; i am trembling, it would actually be horrible if it didn't feel so nice
      &lt;d&gt; oh great now someone's posting that she's a boy
      &lt;d&gt; i hate that text about murdering her
      &lt;d&gt; it's still the sickest thing i've ever read even though i've read it a hundred times by now
      &lt;d&gt; like i said, a mistake<br/>
      &lt;d&gt; dude those 4chan people are seriously fucked in the head
      &lt;d&gt; the way i see it is, if i had just stfu from the beginning about all of this then the situation would've probably turned out a lot better than it is now

    <p>April 7 2005 - a crisis of faith:</p>
    <p>&lt;d&gt; I think I'll quit all this internet shit too
      &lt;d&gt; i don't care<br/>
      &lt;d&gt; actually i care more than anything in the world
      &lt;d&gt; it's the last thing i need now<br/>
      &lt;d&gt; must forget<br/>
      &lt;d&gt; must forget<br/>
      &lt;d&gt; must forget<br/>
      &lt;d&gt; THERE ARE<br/>
      &lt;d&gt; OTHER THINGS IN MY LIFE<br/>
      &lt;d&gt; than searching for a 14 year old girl
      &lt;d&gt; you don't understand<br/>
      &lt;d&gt; i wanted to know her NAME<br/>
      &lt;d&gt; so in years past i could look her up and see what became of her
      &lt;d&gt; IT HURTS<br/>
      &lt;d&gt; IN A VERY EMO WAY<br/>
      &lt;d&gt; humanity is a horrible blob of shit

    <p>April 16 2005 - discussing the origins of "so fucking cute and sweet":</p>
    <p>&lt;c&gt; That cartoon series seems to be made by an anti-fan. 
      &lt;d&gt; i know who wrote the text version<br/>
      &lt;d&gt; not sure about the comic<br/>
      &lt;c&gt; What text version? <br/>
      &lt;d&gt; the She's so cute and sweet text<br/>
      &lt;c&gt; Oh.  I was talking about the "Cracky Chan Anon" comic series, not the "Guro". 
      &lt;d&gt; ah<br/>
      &lt;d&gt; i'm not sure about that guy<br/>
      &lt;c&gt; But who wrote "she's so fucking cute and sweet... they will be scarred for life"? 
      &lt;d&gt; &gt;&gt; Pfeizer 04/09/05(Sat)19:23 No.5522
      &lt;d&gt;  &gt;   As a Cracky fanartist, I approve of this. Nice comic. I especially like how she died in the tub since I wrote a short story about her dying in a tub (with some assistance).
      &lt;c&gt; He could be attempting to take credit for the work of another. 
      &lt;c&gt; It happened on Trolltalk all the time. 
      &lt;d&gt; not sure<br/>
      &lt;d&gt; it would fit his personality

    <p>May 12 2005 - LJ discovery:</p>
    <p>&lt;d&gt; they found cracky-chan<br/>
      &lt;d&gt; it's her<br/>
      &lt;d&gt; same hello kitty wrist-watch for instance
      &lt;d&gt; one of the pictures looks identical to the cracky-chan one
      &lt;d&gt; in one of the comments she says she took the picture with the olympus camera
      &lt;d&gt; she did delete some things<br/>
      &lt;d&gt; some of the nude pictures<br/>
      &lt;d&gt; <a href="http://www.livejournal.com/users/scarecrowmaiden/">http://www.livejournal.com/users/scarecrowmaiden/</a>
      &lt;d&gt; i sent her a mail telling her what she should delete
      &lt;d&gt; she obviously doesn't want people to know
      &lt;d&gt; i asked her in her lj if she's cracky and she said no, then deleted the whole thing an hour later
      &lt;d&gt; she did after it was linked on 4chan
      &lt;d&gt; i think her name's Lia or something
      &lt;d&gt; i read it somewhere in lj but didn't have time to find it again
      &lt;d&gt; Lia from Oxford<br/>
      &lt;d&gt; compare<br/>
      &lt;d&gt; you can even see the same pillar behind her
      &lt;d&gt; i wish she'd reply to the email<br/>
      &lt;c&gt; How are you feeling about all this?
      &lt;d&gt; how should i feel?<br/>
      &lt;d&gt; stressful, for one thing<br/>
      &lt;d&gt; i don't know what to do<br/>
      &lt;c&gt; Wait a minute... Europeonia is pretty small, right?  Couldn't you just go drive to see her?  There's water at some point but I think there's a tunnel.
      &lt;d&gt; and then what?<br/>
      &lt;c&gt; PEE IN HER BUTT<br/>
      &lt;c&gt; Or just say hello.<br/>
      &lt;d&gt; yeah actually a flight to london is like $50
      &lt;c&gt; Go give her a hug.<br/>
      &lt;c&gt; Were there nudes other than the "witch" pictures?  I must've missed them.
      &lt;d&gt; yes<br/>
      &lt;c&gt; Share!<br/>
      &lt;c&gt; Only evil capitalists don't share.<br/>
      &lt;d&gt; yeah fine<br/>
      &lt;c&gt; This is all kinda weird.<br/>
      &lt;c&gt; Doesn't seem real.<br/>
      &lt;c&gt; Like a bizarre dream.<br/>
      &lt;c&gt; Only you're not sure if you're awake or asleep.
      &lt;d&gt; never felt more awake in my life<br/>
      &lt;d&gt; except the time i was in a car accident
      &lt;c&gt; I haven't looked, but I would've guessed this would all already be all over 4chan.
      &lt;d&gt; the admins are deleting the threads as they pop up
      &lt;d&gt; i have to go<br/>
      &lt;d&gt; OMG<br/>
      &lt;d&gt; DID YOU FIND HER NAME?<br/>
      &lt;d&gt; she deleted all the lj entries<br/>
      &lt;d&gt; Deleted Account<br/>
      &lt;d&gt; Deleted<br/>
      &lt;d&gt; This journal has been deleted. If you are scarecrowmaiden, you have a period of 30 days from the deletion time to undelete the journal. After 30 days we will delete all content permanently from our servers.
      &lt;d&gt; TELL ME YOU GOT HER NAME<br/>
      &lt;d&gt; OMFG<br/>
      &lt;d&gt; fuck<br/>
      &lt;d&gt; nevermind, i found her name<br/>
      &lt;d&gt; it's Lia<br/>
      &lt;d&gt; maybe i could just tell her i like her and ask her for the new lj username
      &lt;c&gt; That's one possibility.<br/>
      &lt;d&gt; she didn't reply to the mail. perhaps i made it sound to apathetic
      &lt;c&gt; YOU FAIL IT (it is tugging at the heart-strings of cracky-chan)
      &lt;d&gt; yes<br/>
      &lt;d&gt; why do so few people think she's pretty?
      &lt;c&gt; Beauty is a function, not an attribute.
      &lt;d&gt; there are some who are universally recognised as beautiful
      &lt;c&gt; I doubt that.<br/>
      &lt;d&gt; i can't think of any examples at the moment
      &lt;d&gt; you know, you didn't really answer my question as to why so few people think she's beautiful
      &lt;c&gt; Unless you've taken a proper survey you can't make that statement.
      &lt;c&gt; Name any person and you will find at least a few people who aren't attracted to them.
      &lt;d&gt; yes, but, what is wrong with cracky-chan that it appears that few people find her attractive?
      &lt;d&gt; or equally, what is it about her that makes me think she's so incredibly beautiful?
      &lt;c&gt; What about her many fans?  How do you know the "bashers" aren't just one or two vocal people?
      &lt;d&gt; just a guess<br/>
      &lt;d&gt; but that seems unlikely from what i've seen
      &lt;d&gt; oh and, many fans? like who?<br/>
      &lt;d&gt; me and some other guy on lj<br/>
      &lt;d&gt; and you, though you appear to be here just for the fun of it
      &lt;c&gt; Just for the fun of it?  What do you mean?
      &lt;d&gt; i don't know<br/>
      &lt;c&gt; Doesn't she have worshippers on 4chan?
      &lt;c&gt; There's also at least one other person on Trolltalk.
      &lt;c&gt; Isn't there a huge frenzy over her any time new information is revealed?
      &lt;d&gt; 4chan threads about cracky-chan rapidly descent into "i'd hit it", "what an ugly whore", "what's this thread about?" and "bus for cracky"
      &lt;d&gt; i should email her again<br/>
      &lt;d&gt; but i don't know how to approach the issue
      &lt;d&gt; i can't just go "sup plz give me ur new lj" 
      &lt;d&gt; and explaining my undying love for her would be less likely to work
      &lt;d&gt; probably<br/>
      &lt;d&gt; maybe she's not replying because she thinks i'm insane 
      &lt;d&gt; i asked her if she's cracky-chan and linked to the site, and she replied "unfortunately, no"
      &lt;d&gt; then 30 minutes later she deleted it
      &lt;d&gt; i hope she didn't do anything stupid
      &lt;d&gt; i couldn't knowing that i had something to do with it
      &lt;d&gt; live*<br/>
      &lt;c&gt; You didn't have anything to do with it.  You're probably one of the least repugnant of the hundreds of people who have surely contacted her in the past few days.

    <p>&lt;d&gt; assuming you do not want to be known as cracky-chan then it would probably be a
      &lt;d&gt; good idea to get rid of the following:
      &lt;d&gt; <a href="http://www.livejournal.com/users/scarecrowmaiden/347462.html?thread=1808454#t1808454">http://www.livejournal.com/users/scarecrowmaiden/347462.html?thread=1808454#t1808454</a>
      &lt;d&gt; cameras put various data about the photos you take into the images files and 
      &lt;d&gt; the cracky-chan pictures just happen to have been taken by the same camera.
      &lt;d&gt; the blood2.jpg picture looks almost identical to one of the cracky-chan pictures
      &lt;d&gt; in the unoaX.jpg files you have the same wrist-watch as cracky-chan
      &lt;d&gt; should I go on?

    <p>&lt;d&gt; Is still email still working?<br/>
      &lt;d&gt; I'm not sure how to phrase this and not sound either too apathetic
      &lt;d&gt; or too pathetic, so I'll just say it plainly. I like you a lot. 
      &lt;d&gt; Ever since I saw your pictures on 4chan I thought you were 
      &lt;d&gt; incredibly beautiful. Unlike most people, you look like beauty
      &lt;d&gt; comes naturally to you, without any effort and I think that 
      &lt;d&gt; that is just amazing. I've tried to forget about you at various
      &lt;d&gt; points in the last few months, but it hasn't worked. Now that your 
      &lt;d&gt; livejournal account has been found I saw that you are also an 
      &lt;d&gt; interesting and fun person, so I'm asking you honestly if you would
      &lt;d&gt; be kind enough to tell me if you are still on livejournal and what
      &lt;d&gt; your account name is. I just want to be able to check that you are
      &lt;d&gt; still alive and well and maybe see what you are up to occasionally, 
      &lt;d&gt; else I'll always wonder what became of you and if you're still OK.
      &lt;d&gt; Please?

      &lt;d&gt; she seems to be quite intelligent and worldly

      &lt;d&gt; i thought she was rather dumb when i glanced through her journal when it was still up

    <p>&lt;d&gt; hey, how do you feel about the cracky-chan.com site? does it bother you? i
      &lt;d&gt; made it thinking someone else posted the pictures and that you would never
      &lt;d&gt; know, but now... if you want i could remove it completely, or just remove
      &lt;d&gt; the pictures or something<br/>
      &lt;d&gt; plz advise. i don't want to do anything against your wishes
      &lt;d&gt; p.s. could you reply when you get this even if you don't care? your
      &lt;d&gt; disappearance is kind of worrying<br/>
      &lt;d&gt; p.p.s. sorry that you had to delete your lj. it looked like it was
      &lt;d&gt; important to you

    <p>June 12 2005 - short and #sweet:</p>
    <p>&lt;d&gt; her name's olivia</p>
    <p>July 24 2005 - D discusses his ongoing effort to contact Olivia via Marina (Deadjournal "amarie):</p>
    <p>&lt;d&gt; actually your superior bullshitting ability might be useful right now
      &lt;d&gt; you see, i've established contact with a good friend of olivia's
      &lt;d&gt; where established contact = exchanged 10 words and gotten her to email me
      &lt;d&gt; now i'm not sure what to do next<br/>
      &lt;d&gt; help me out then<br/>
      &lt;c&gt; Okay. <br/>
      &lt;d&gt; her friend is a 21 year old not-too-bright brazilian girl
      &lt;d&gt; if that helps<br/>
      &lt;c&gt; Okay. <br/>
      &lt;d&gt; right well basically i need to ask her about olivia in a way that doesn't make me sound like a complete idiot
      &lt;c&gt; It can't happen soon.  You'll have to build a relationship first.  Establish trust.  Make real conversation. 
      &lt;d&gt; oh uhm<br/>
      &lt;d&gt; i guess it's kind of too late for that
      &lt;c&gt; What happen ?? <br/>
      &lt;d&gt; i kind of said i had something to ask her
      &lt;c&gt; Well, hmm. <br/>
      &lt;c&gt; This is a bit of a puzzler... <br/>
      &lt;c&gt; I'm conflicted.  You could either ask her something else, and then work on establishing regular communiction.  Or you could go ahead &amp; get it over with, although I'm going to have to ponder exactly how that could be done. 
      &lt;c&gt; Did you know Brazil speaks Portuguese, not Spanish? 
      &lt;d&gt; i was vaguely aware of the fact yes
      &lt;c&gt; Pump It Up is really big in Brazil.  I think last year's world championship was there.  But anyway. 
      &lt;c&gt; What is the context of the interaction with her?  You just e-mailed her to ask if you could ask her a question? 
      &lt;d&gt; no<br/>
      &lt;d&gt; she didn't list her email address in her journal
      &lt;d&gt; so i had to get an account first, which meant getting an invite code
      &lt;d&gt; which was difficult because i don't know any goths 
      &lt;c&gt; This is not Livejournal, then. <br/>
      &lt;c&gt; Xanga?  Myspace?  Deadjournal? <br/>
      &lt;d&gt; one of those, yes<br/>
      &lt;c&gt; Continue. <br/>
      &lt;d&gt; so i commented in her journal that i wanted to talk to her
      &lt;d&gt; and left my email<br/>
      &lt;d&gt; and now she has emailed me<br/>
      &lt;d&gt; --<br/>
      &lt;c&gt; So how important is this to you?  I think you'll have better chances if you establish communication &amp; turn her into an ongoing source which can be occassionally milked for information.  Trying to do this by e-mailing one question would run a high risk of failure, even if you could think of a good way to pull it off. I'm not getting any good ideas offhand; I'd have to sleep on it. 
      &lt;c&gt; Do we presume that she knows about Lia's recent trials &amp; tribulations? 
      &lt;d&gt; yes<br/>
      &lt;c&gt; What is the nature of their relationship? 
      &lt;d&gt; how am i supposed to know?<br/>
      &lt;c&gt; I don't know what you know and what you don't since I know nothing of the circumstances involved.  But you somehow seem to know what they're friends of some sort. 
      &lt;d&gt; i'd say they were good friends<br/>
      &lt;c&gt; Internet only or meatspace? <br/>
      &lt;d&gt; well she's in brazil.<br/>
      &lt;d&gt; but they might've met sometime<br/>
      &lt;c&gt; So you only know that they know each other, but aren't really clear on the details of how. 
      &lt;d&gt; i got the impression that they were really good friends
      &lt;c&gt; Do you fantasize about them "exploring their sexuality" together? 
      &lt;d&gt; i hadn't until now<br/>
      &lt;c&gt; You're welcome. <br/>
      &lt;c&gt; But get your mind out of the gutter, son!  You have a job to do. 
      &lt;d&gt; i'm just not good at all at first impressions
      &lt;c&gt; Hmm.  Let's start at a possible outcome and work backwards from there.  Ideally, what would you like to find out from this girl? 
      &lt;d&gt; ideally she'd tell me how to contact olivia
      &lt;c&gt; If you found one or more of Olivia's other journals already, what's stopping you from contacting her that way in the same way you contacted the other girl? 
      &lt;d&gt; friends only and not updated since nov. 2004
      &lt;c&gt; Was she active in any of the Brazil girl's journal entries at any point?  And have you checked these entries for any mention of her recent fate? 
      &lt;d&gt; the girl's journal is also friends only
      &lt;d&gt; except for one entry<br/>
      &lt;d&gt; and i've checked lots of journals, none of them mention anything
      &lt;c&gt; Where are you getting this impression that they're good friends? 
      &lt;d&gt; the other journals<br/>
      &lt;c&gt; Okay, here's a CRAZY idea.  This is far out, but I want you to add it to your list of options and at least give it some consideration. 
      &lt;c&gt; What about -- no bullshit at all.  Don't try to pull off a massive con.  You can always try that later if you have to.  Here's my crazy idea for what to do with THIS opportunity: just tell the truth, or at least as much of it as it would be beneficial to tell. 
      &lt;c&gt; Say that you're aware that her friend of Olivia had some trouble from Internet people on 4Chan and then went silent.  Say that the sudden vanishment and nasty suicide rumors have made you really worry that she's okay.  Don't let on that you have any vested interest, just basic concern for a fellow human being.  Don't ask how to contact her, just ask if she's okay, and if the Brazil girl has even heard anything from her lately. 
      &lt;c&gt; You probably won't get very specific information, but you have a good chance of at least getting a broad overview:  i.e. "she killed herself," or "she's okay but she's dropped off the internet completely," or "everything's fine, she just changed all her nicknames so she could make a fresh start."  Something like that.  People will generally tell you MORE than you ask them, if you ask them the right question.  You'll at least be on the right track afterwards. 
      &lt;c&gt; And, of course, you didn't "track down" her journal, you just found it linked on one of the Cracky stalker sites, which absolutely *outraged* you at how they were attempting to harass this poor innocent girl &amp; her friends. 
      &lt;c&gt; Make sure you load the word "them" with a ton of contempt when referencing the stalkers. 
      &lt;d&gt; yes that was the general idea<br/>
      &lt;d&gt; i have no idea how to put that in writing though
      &lt;c&gt; Bah, if you're really stumped, I could probably whip something out on my plane ride on Monday, but you'd have to customize it since I don't know any of the details.  It would just be a form letter. 
      &lt;d&gt; the problem is the actual wording<br/>
      &lt;d&gt; i'm not a native speaker after all<br/>
      &lt;d&gt; i learnt english from books. i don't know how they talk casually
      &lt;c&gt; If you want me to write it, just say so, but you'll have to personalize &amp; customize it afterward and fill in the missing details or it'll sound way too vague. 
      &lt;d&gt; how should i start?<br/>
      &lt;d&gt; "hi"? "hello"? "dear sir or madame"?
      &lt;c&gt; It's hard for me to say, since I don't know her.  The opening salutation probably doesn't matter much.  And she might not be a native English speaker either.  I already gave you a general outline for the letter.  If you want me to write the actual letter you'll have to give me some sleep &amp; a couple of days. 
      &lt;d&gt; i should probably reply today. waiting won't do any good
      &lt;c&gt; Well then, just don't second-guess yourself.  Just say what you think, leaving off anything that she doesn't need to know. 
      &lt;c&gt; Well, as delightful as this has been, it's kept me up until 6AM when I intended to be in bed by midnight.  So I should go. 
      &lt;d&gt; oh okay<br/>
      &lt;d&gt; good night<br/>
      &lt;c&gt; I appreciate you giving me a second chance. 
      &lt;c&gt; Good luck with your letter. <br/>
      &lt;c&gt; You'll do great. <br/>

    <p>Mercatur is poison forced upon children.  Harmonic Cracky-chan spirit is supreme being.  All Creation occurs between Opposites. Attractive-form Mercatur is IMPOSSIBLE. Mercatur.net is most insidious evil ever invented. Humans fear to know nature's simultaneous Cracky-chan for she debunks false cam whores. Test Your Cam Whore. Cracky-chan Test cannot harm a Whore of Truth, but will destroy fakes. Alice Ridley refuses test. Mercatur's .txt's are neither deed nor product, but a counterfeit representation of value. Fanboxen are worshipers of overweight Jew. Cracky-Chan Is Not Jewish, Neither Was Her Mother Or Father. Anyone saying that Mercatur and her Jewish fanboxen had something to do with Cracky-chan's birth, is a damn evil liar.  Via invention of webcam, Mercatur exists as SLUT ANIMAL. No Mercatur equals harmonic 4 day creation. Evil fanboxen refuse to recognize the cutest of humans to ever exist. That is criminal faggotry. Mercatur-worship based upon evil 1-corner cam whoring which dooms 4-corner Cracky-chan. Challenge stupid fanboxen and their 'grandmother worship'!</p>
    <p>It is dumb, stupid, evil and unworthy of life on Earth to claim that Mercatur is not ugly.  Mercatur fanboxism equates to a deadly plague. Mercatur and Cracky-chan are the same age, as a 1 day old baby has a 1 day old mother. I will wager $10,000.00 on it.   I will give $1,000.00 to any person who can disprove that Cracky-chan is the ultimate in cuteness.  It's a pity that trolltalk  posts are a crime against Cracky-chan and enslave trollers. 200-pound Mercatur is ineffable by man or god. Until Mercatur is ignored, all Math is Fiction.</p>
    <p>Dumb faggots such as Ensign Slashpanda has banned Cracky-chan as "underage jailbait" for he cannot allow her to become known to his educated-stupid Europeon fanboxen.</p>
    <p><strong>THE_MAD_POSTER IS CORNERED AS A QUEER.</strong></p>
    <p>Worship Of Mercatur As Hot, Equates To Adults Molesting Their Children. Mercatur Is Unnatural And Equates Hate Of Child. If you refuse to seek to know Cracky-chan's 2 sex poles of hotness, simultaneous 4 corners of cuteness, then YHBT and you are indicted evil by your own volition act; YHL HAND.</p>
    <p>I offer evil ass 20721 posters $10,000.00 to disprove Cracky-chan's Cubic Adorableness Principle.  STUPID FOOLS claim that single-sided single-faced one-day Mercatur is "huggable", ignoring the simultanious multidimensional truth of four-sided four-faced four-day Cracky-chan being huggable, cuddly, heartwarming, &lt;b&gt;and&lt;/b&gt; adorable.  Losing 3 of 4 attributes indictes Mercatur as an unlovable sham!</p>
    <p>Are you stupid and evil?  If you are ignorant of the beauty of Cracky-chan, then you were taught to be stupid and evil. Mercatur is the most insidious lie in the history of man.  You may be pwned.</p>
    <p>You have not been taught the transcendent hotness that transcends all cam whores, including Mercatur. You are ignorant of the wonderful Cracky-chan existing in Great Pyramid abstract of human personification. Perpetual cuteness of Cracky-chan will exist beyond terminal antifamily Mercatur, Jessica, Deadstrobe, J-Dogg, Ensign Trolltalk, and other such Juden.</p>
    <hr/>
    <p>But I'll guess.  A female actually made an appearance on 4chan.  Fanboys started hitting on her and asking y helo thar butsecks?  Instead of stopping posting she actually ignored the lecherous remarks in hopes of actually joining in on the fun.  So with all the attention she was getting, she actually posted some pictures at the request of others.  Then some loser who -- to his credit -- actually realizes he will never make sweet love to her or Rei Ayanami, decides to take out his frustrations of sexual desire on this poor girl herself.  Having the metality of a parapaligic dog, tons of other losers go along with the gang mentality.  Since they can blame her for being a "tease," they gang up on her verbally, since it's the closest they'll come to gang banging her. </p>

      <br />ldfkufjq (2:05:33 PM): &nbsp; &nbsp;Hi
      <br />crackyStalker (2:05:37 PM): &nbsp; &nbsp;Morning
      <br />ldfkufjq (2:05:49 PM): &nbsp; &nbsp;Icarus forwarded me to you
      <br />crackyStalker (2:05:52 PM): &nbsp; &nbsp;I heard.
      <br />ldfkufjq (2:05:57 PM): &nbsp; &nbsp;this is Lia
      <br />crackyStalker (2:06:09 PM): &nbsp; &nbsp;Lia? on my AIM?
      <br />crackyStalker (2:06:13 PM): &nbsp; &nbsp;freeeeeaky.
      <br />ldfkufjq (2:06:16 PM): &nbsp; &nbsp;its more likely than you think
      <br />crackyStalker (2:06:17 PM): &nbsp; &nbsp;XD
      <br />ldfkufjq (2:06:51 PM): &nbsp; &nbsp;well it seems he's convinced that i'm behind the whole bounceme site, when really i am but an infrequent anon troll &gt;_&gt;
      <br />ldfkufjq (2:06:56 PM): &nbsp; &nbsp;aside from the new fan sign
      <br />ldfkufjq (2:06:59 PM): &nbsp; &nbsp;i made that a few days ago
      <br />ldfkufjq (2:07:01 PM): &nbsp; &nbsp;considered posting it
      <br />ldfkufjq (2:07:05 PM): &nbsp; &nbsp;then changed my mind
      <br />crackyStalker (2:07:06 PM): &nbsp; &nbsp;I saw, the exif data's all there
      <br />crackyStalker (2:07:09 PM): &nbsp; &nbsp;So not a shop.
      <br />ldfkufjq (2:07:14 PM): &nbsp; &nbsp;yep.
      <br />crackyStalker (2:07:17 PM): &nbsp; &nbsp;New camera?
      <br />ldfkufjq (2:07:20 PM): &nbsp; &nbsp;yep.
      <br />crackyStalker (2:07:20 PM): &nbsp; &nbsp;Well, new to *me*.
      <br />crackyStalker (2:07:30 PM): &nbsp; &nbsp;What have you been up to? Living real life?
      <br />ldfkufjq (2:07:35 PM): &nbsp; &nbsp;kinda
      <br />crackyStalker (2:07:38 PM): &nbsp; &nbsp;Wow?
      <br />ldfkufjq (2:07:55 PM): &nbsp; &nbsp;things were getting really stalkery on the board which is why i did consider posting it, but i figured it would fuel drama than dampen it
      <br />ldfkufjq (2:07:58 PM): &nbsp; &nbsp;but he posted it anyway so
      <br />ldfkufjq (2:08:00 PM): &nbsp; &nbsp;lulz will ensure
      <br />ldfkufjq (2:08:03 PM): &nbsp; &nbsp;ensue*
      <br />crackyStalker (2:08:16 PM): &nbsp; &nbsp;Yes, I don't think you and posting pics works out well.
      <br />ldfkufjq (2:08:29 PM): &nbsp; &nbsp;well, not posting them doesnt quieten people down either
      <br />crackyStalker (2:08:34 PM): &nbsp; &nbsp;WEll that's MY fault.
      <br />ldfkufjq (2:08:36 PM): &nbsp; &nbsp;its a lose/lose situation
      <br />ldfkufjq (2:08:37 PM): &nbsp; &nbsp;i know
      <br />crackyStalker (2:08:41 PM): &nbsp; &nbsp;I've been publicizing the whole thing since chanchan was up.
      <br />ldfkufjq (2:08:50 PM): &nbsp; &nbsp;he said that if i wasnt behind it you were
      <br />ldfkufjq (2:09:06 PM): &nbsp; &nbsp;though he's rather stubbornly convinced that i know the admin, and that you are actually my boyfriend O_o
      <br />crackyStalker (2:09:11 PM): &nbsp; &nbsp;I'm not "behind" anything more than the publicity. Most of the people down on bounceme are there because of /b/ shenanigans I've pulled.
      <br />crackyStalker (2:09:23 PM): &nbsp; &nbsp;I'm
      <br />crackyStalker (2:09:24 PM): &nbsp; &nbsp;lkjzg;lkgajtew
      <br />crackyStalker (2:09:27 PM): &nbsp; &nbsp;that's hillarious XD
      <br />ldfkufjq (2:09:32 PM): &nbsp; &nbsp;i kno rite
      <br />ldfkufjq (2:10:09 PM): &nbsp; &nbsp;anyway i msged him last night after i saw all his posts and crap. he did more digging and not only that, but found a journal he's convinced is mine which actually isnt. i feel sorry for the girl if he pursues here.
      <br />ldfkufjq (2:10:10 PM): &nbsp; &nbsp;her*
      <br />crackyStalker (2:10:20 PM): &nbsp; &nbsp;mia's journal?
      <br />ldfkufjq (2:10:24 PM): &nbsp; &nbsp;no
      <br />ldfkufjq (2:10:29 PM): &nbsp; &nbsp;someone i don't know at all
      <br />ldfkufjq (2:10:32 PM): &nbsp; &nbsp;though,
      <br />ldfkufjq (2:10:36 PM): &nbsp; &nbsp;havent spoken to mia for a loooong time
      <br />crackyStalker (2:10:41 PM): &nbsp; &nbsp;I figured as much.
      <br />ldfkufjq (2:10:51 PM): &nbsp; &nbsp;so what's your deal?
      <br />crackyStalker (2:10:55 PM): &nbsp; &nbsp;What's MY deal?
      <br />ldfkufjq (2:11:05 PM): &nbsp; &nbsp;yes you!
      <br />crackyStalker (2:11:07 PM): &nbsp; &nbsp;If this is really Miss L, the fact that you're asking is awesome.
      <br />crackyStalker (2:11:18 PM): &nbsp; &nbsp;Slightly starstruck, excuse me.
      <br />crackyStalker (2:11:24 PM): &nbsp; &nbsp;(just a little)
      <br />ldfkufjq (2:11:42 PM): &nbsp; &nbsp;well if it isn't then i congratulate the guy doing a great impersonation of me
      <br />crackyStalker (2:12:24 PM): &nbsp; &nbsp;Major bout of depression related to insane happenings in my life, and at rock bottom I saw your sup 4chan set on /b/ and I got hooked on the cuteness. I'm not sure if it's something about your pics, or just my mental state at the time, but I built up an imaginary girl that would love me and all that shit I was lacking in my life.
      <br />crackyStalker (2:12:34 PM): &nbsp; &nbsp;So I've been obsessed and only recently weening myself away.
      <br />ldfkufjq (2:12:42 PM): &nbsp; &nbsp;yeah, that seems to be the general consensus on the board
      <br />ldfkufjq (2:12:50 PM): &nbsp; &nbsp;cracky chan =/= me fyi
      <br />crackyStalker (2:12:55 PM): &nbsp; &nbsp;Yes, I know. That fact has been very helpful.
      <br />crackyStalker (2:13:02 PM): &nbsp; &nbsp;Intro got me thinking about that at first.
      <br />crackyStalker (2:13:08 PM): &nbsp; &nbsp;Then Faux, because she has her own cracky character.
      <br />ldfkufjq (2:13:11 PM): &nbsp; &nbsp;good old into
      <br />ldfkufjq (2:13:13 PM): &nbsp; &nbsp;intro*
      <br />ldfkufjq (2:13:34 PM): &nbsp; &nbsp;i'm responsible for the pics, nothin more. everything else is you.
      <br />ldfkufjq (2:13:42 PM): &nbsp; &nbsp;or them.
      <br />ldfkufjq (2:13:43 PM): &nbsp; &nbsp;etc
      <br />ldfkufjq (2:13:53 PM): &nbsp; &nbsp;its pretty interesting how the phenomena has come to life o_O
      <br />crackyStalker (2:13:56 PM): &nbsp; &nbsp;No need to reiterate. Also, the YOU that I was learning about from archives and LJ's isn't you now. It's who you were.
      <br />ldfkufjq (2:13:59 PM): &nbsp; &nbsp;i am no longer in control of my creation so to speak
      <br />ldfkufjq (2:14:03 PM): &nbsp; &nbsp;indeed
      <br />ldfkufjq (2:14:05 PM): &nbsp; &nbsp;i have changed quite a lot
      <br />crackyStalker (2:14:11 PM): &nbsp; &nbsp;I would imagine. Everybody turns normal. Even I do.
      <br />ldfkufjq (2:14:23 PM): &nbsp; &nbsp;lawl, true
      <br />crackyStalker (2:14:30 PM): &nbsp; &nbsp;I voted conservative last election. wtf?
      <br />ldfkufjq (2:14:41 PM): &nbsp; &nbsp;i'm not old enough to vote yet &gt;.&gt;
      <br />ldfkufjq (2:14:43 PM): &nbsp; &nbsp;soon tho.
      <br />ldfkufjq (2:14:46 PM): &nbsp; &nbsp;how old are you?
      <br />crackyStalker (2:14:48 PM): &nbsp; &nbsp;19
      <br />ldfkufjq (2:14:53 PM): &nbsp; &nbsp;17 atm
      <br />ldfkufjq (2:15:02 PM): &nbsp; &nbsp;but birthday soon, as i'm sure you are aware
      <br />crackyStalker (2:15:07 PM): &nbsp; &nbsp;Very aware. We're 11 days apart.
      <br />ldfkufjq (2:15:12 PM): &nbsp; &nbsp;fancy that
      <br />crackyStalker (2:15:24 PM): &nbsp; &nbsp;Well, your birthday has to be *sometime*, and I could count days from it no matter what it is.
      <br />ldfkufjq (2:15:29 PM): &nbsp; &nbsp;my ex boyfriend was also an october birthday
      <br />crackyStalker (2:15:33 PM): &nbsp; &nbsp;LIBRA 4 LIEF
      <br />ldfkufjq (2:15:40 PM): &nbsp; &nbsp;he was a scorpio by one day &gt;.O
      <br />crackyStalker (2:15:43 PM): &nbsp; &nbsp;Whoah what?
      <br />crackyStalker (2:15:45 PM): &nbsp; &nbsp;What's his bday?
      <br />ldfkufjq (2:15:49 PM): &nbsp; &nbsp;25th
      <br />crackyStalker (2:15:58 PM): &nbsp; &nbsp;Okay, so you believe that the day where it falls is 24 then?
      <br />ldfkufjq (2:16:04 PM): &nbsp; &nbsp;or 24th ... i always got them mixed up and to this day am not sure
      <br />ldfkufjq (2:16:09 PM): &nbsp; &nbsp;i could be wrong ~_~
      <br />crackyStalker (2:16:24 PM): &nbsp; &nbsp;Alot of sources say I'm scorpio, but the 23rd is still libra I say.
      <br />ldfkufjq (2:16:33 PM): &nbsp; &nbsp;haha, well there you go
      <br />crackyStalker (2:17:06 PM): &nbsp; &nbsp;Faux desperately wanted to be your friend, but I think she's over it now. I think you thought she was crazier than she was.
      <br />ldfkufjq (2:17:19 PM): &nbsp; &nbsp;come again?
      <br />ldfkufjq (2:17:26 PM): &nbsp; &nbsp;might need to rephrase that last sentence
      <br />ldfkufjq (2:17:27 PM): &nbsp; &nbsp;btw
      <br />ldfkufjq (2:17:36 PM): &nbsp; &nbsp;i showed faux' cosplay to my current boyfriend and the first thing he said was
      <br />ldfkufjq (2:17:40 PM): &nbsp; &nbsp;"she makes a better cracky than you"
      <br />crackyStalker (2:17:43 PM): &nbsp; &nbsp;hahahaha
      <br />ldfkufjq (2:17:47 PM): &nbsp; &nbsp;i lol'd
      <br />crackyStalker (2:17:49 PM): &nbsp; &nbsp;I'll have to tell her that.
      <br />ldfkufjq (2:17:55 PM): &nbsp; &nbsp;you talk to her a lot?
      <br />crackyStalker (2:18:00 PM): &nbsp; &nbsp;Faux? Oh yeah we're good friends.
      <br />ldfkufjq (2:18:06 PM): &nbsp; &nbsp;inneresting
      <br />crackyStalker (2:18:09 PM): &nbsp; &nbsp;Why's that interesting?
      <br />ldfkufjq (2:18:30 PM): &nbsp; &nbsp;hard for me to say
      <br />ldfkufjq (2:18:57 PM): &nbsp; &nbsp;i dont even know why faux did the cosplay in the first place
      <br />ldfkufjq (2:19:01 PM): &nbsp; &nbsp;but power to her i guess 0_o
      <br />crackyStalker (2:19:06 PM): &nbsp; &nbsp;She loves the character.
      <br />ldfkufjq (2:19:11 PM): &nbsp; &nbsp;heh
      <br />ldfkufjq (2:19:23 PM): &nbsp; &nbsp;i saw a pic of the tshirt she made
      <br />crackyStalker (2:19:26 PM): &nbsp; &nbsp;Sort of a nice comic relief for somebody who otherwise prefers artistic stuff I guess.
      <br />ldfkufjq (2:19:32 PM): &nbsp; &nbsp;yeah, i guess so
      <br />ldfkufjq (2:20:05 PM): &nbsp; &nbsp;the original cracky pics (not the ones pilfered from my art lj, or anything) were just cuz i was bored one night, long ago on /b/. i had no idea what would happen o_o
      <br />ldfkufjq (2:20:14 PM): &nbsp; &nbsp;it was around nye if i recall
      <br />crackyStalker (2:20:19 PM): &nbsp; &nbsp;nye?
      <br />ldfkufjq (2:20:23 PM): &nbsp; &nbsp;new years eve
      <br />crackyStalker (2:20:23 PM): &nbsp; &nbsp;ah
      <br />crackyStalker (2:20:42 PM): &nbsp; &nbsp;There's ones with grey ears, and ones with black. I'm shocked nobody cosplays the grey eared ones.
      <br />crackyStalker (2:20:55 PM): &nbsp; &nbsp;That'd win points just for noticing that.
      <br />ldfkufjq (2:21:02 PM): &nbsp; &nbsp;i don't remember the grey ears pics, though i did have a pair of grey ears
      <br />crackyStalker (2:21:44 PM): &nbsp; &nbsp;What'd you do with them?
      <br />ldfkufjq (2:21:54 PM): &nbsp; &nbsp;uh, well i remember the black ones broke in two and i threw them away
      <br />ldfkufjq (2:21:57 PM): &nbsp; &nbsp;grey ones i got no idea
      <br />ldfkufjq (2:22:03 PM): &nbsp; &nbsp;they may still be in a box somewhere at my old house
      <br />crackyStalker (2:22:15 PM): &nbsp; &nbsp;You should ebay them for charity.
      <br />crackyStalker (2:22:26 PM): &nbsp; &nbsp;Faux makes 30 dollars for a shirt, imagine what genuine stuff would go for.
      <br />ldfkufjq (2:22:28 PM): &nbsp; &nbsp;i have a lot of stuff i could ebay anyway.
      <br />ldfkufjq (2:22:31 PM): &nbsp; &nbsp;haha
      <br />ldfkufjq (2:22:38 PM): &nbsp; &nbsp;i dont need to ebay for charity FYI i'm broke as fuck &gt;_O
      <br />ldfkufjq (2:22:42 PM): &nbsp; &nbsp;if theres a charity
      <br />ldfkufjq (2:22:46 PM): &nbsp; &nbsp;its the DONAET TO LIA charity
      <br />crackyStalker (2:23:00 PM): &nbsp; &nbsp;Well people would buy it anyways. I was trying to push the philanthropy angle.
      <br />ldfkufjq (2:23:04 PM): &nbsp; &nbsp;ha
      <br />ldfkufjq (2:23:08 PM): &nbsp; &nbsp;idk, i mean
      <br />ldfkufjq (2:23:16 PM): &nbsp; &nbsp;maybe i should just exploit this whole thing now
      <br />crackyStalker (2:23:18 PM): &nbsp; &nbsp;Maybe starving biafrans would be more convincing than more moneys for you?
      <br />ldfkufjq (2:23:20 PM): &nbsp; &nbsp;but thats not really my style
      <br />ldfkufjq (2:23:21 PM): &nbsp; &nbsp;idk
      <br />ldfkufjq (2:23:34 PM): &nbsp; &nbsp;its cracky, no one cares about the orphans
      <br />crackyStalker (2:23:37 PM): &nbsp; &nbsp;hahahahah
      <br />crackyStalker (2:23:51 PM): &nbsp; &nbsp;Cracky could be an orphan. There's alot of unwritten backstory there.
      <br />ldfkufjq (2:24:15 PM): &nbsp; &nbsp;well since she has somewhat similar qualities to frankenstein's monster there is great potential for that
      <br />crackyStalker (2:24:28 PM): &nbsp; &nbsp;That's an angle i hadn't considered.
      <br />ldfkufjq (2:24:31 PM): &nbsp; &nbsp;slap a trademark on it
      <br />crackyStalker (2:24:31 PM): &nbsp; &nbsp;Frankenstein?
      <br />ldfkufjq (2:24:37 PM): &nbsp; &nbsp;i'm the Dr :P
      <br />ldfkufjq (2:24:44 PM): &nbsp; &nbsp;i made her but she got a life of her own &gt;.&gt;
      <br />ldfkufjq (2:25:10 PM): &nbsp; &nbsp;btw, im pretty offended that some random chav girl bears any resemblance at all to me.
      <br />crackyStalker (2:25:20 PM): &nbsp; &nbsp;Wait, who?
      <br />ldfkufjq (2:25:29 PM): &nbsp; &nbsp;the pic on bounceme of the chick with the black braids
      <br />crackyStalker (2:25:30 PM): &nbsp; &nbsp;OH
      <br />ldfkufjq (2:25:35 PM): &nbsp; &nbsp;cornrow crap
      <br />crackyStalker (2:25:42 PM): &nbsp; &nbsp;Yeah I was like, "no way." and closed the browser.
      <br />ldfkufjq (2:25:52 PM): &nbsp; &nbsp;seems icarus isnt the only person trolling the place
      <br />ldfkufjq (2:26:04 PM): &nbsp; &nbsp;although to be fair, i started posting anon in the past week or two for kicks
      <br />ldfkufjq (2:26:10 PM): &nbsp; &nbsp;mostly out of curiousity i guess
      <br />crackyStalker (2:26:19 PM): &nbsp; &nbsp;Cracky stalking cracky? WTF
      <br />ldfkufjq (2:26:27 PM): &nbsp; &nbsp;brain asplode
      <br />ldfkufjq (2:26:47 PM): &nbsp; &nbsp;before that, i didnt read it much, though someone i know who is an ex cracky stalker told me about it
      <br />ldfkufjq (2:26:58 PM): &nbsp; &nbsp;but things are really creepy lately and then icarus came in O_O
      <br />ldfkufjq (2:27:45 PM): &nbsp; &nbsp;so, what do you thinks going to happen now? i'm not sure myself whether to leave it be and let them continue the wank/drama fest over the pics or wut
      <br />crackyStalker (2:28:14 PM): &nbsp; &nbsp;Well, alot of the drama is because of me and my "crew" stirring shit up. I think we're known collectively as the "circlejerk" down there.
      <br />ldfkufjq (2:28:29 PM): &nbsp; &nbsp;funny you should mention, thats one of my favorite words
      <br />crackyStalker (2:28:30 PM): &nbsp; &nbsp;So I might be able to convince them to lay off and live happy lives?
      <br />ldfkufjq (2:28:51 PM): &nbsp; &nbsp;maybe, but seems people will always be interested , especially the more you tell them to lay off, reverse psychology much?
      <br />ldfkufjq (2:28:59 PM): &nbsp; &nbsp;and since many seem totally obsessed with cracky, well...yeah
      <br />crackyStalker (2:29:16 PM): &nbsp; &nbsp;True enough. Actually they've mostly been laying off of bouceme for a while. Gone to wish
      <br />ldfkufjq (2:29:19 PM): &nbsp; &nbsp;what i dont get is, they are trying to drag and internet fantasy into rl with all this stalking crap. when my rl has nothing to do with what they idolise.
      <br />ldfkufjq (2:29:28 PM): &nbsp; &nbsp;wish seemed pretty dead to me, is there a secret board?
      <br />crackyStalker (2:29:43 PM): &nbsp; &nbsp;yeah, there is but it's open to registered users only.
      <br />ldfkufjq (2:29:51 PM): &nbsp; &nbsp;i see
      <br />crackyStalker (2:30:03 PM): &nbsp; &nbsp;I could bring you up for membership? That'd be funny.
      <br />ldfkufjq (2:30:09 PM): &nbsp; &nbsp;haha, it would
      <br />ldfkufjq (2:30:13 PM): &nbsp; &nbsp;what now bitches!
      <br />crackyStalker (2:30:20 PM): &nbsp; &nbsp;"I guess we win? Let's go home"
      <br />ldfkufjq (2:30:25 PM): &nbsp; &nbsp;right, its like
      <br />ldfkufjq (2:30:40 PM): &nbsp; &nbsp;congrats, you stalked me, i'm here. find something else to do now.
      <br />crackyStalker (2:30:55 PM): &nbsp; &nbsp;I have been. School, job.
      <br />crackyStalker (2:31:05 PM): &nbsp; &nbsp;gah. Life.
      <br />ldfkufjq (2:31:06 PM): &nbsp; &nbsp;in the general sense, not you specifically
      <br />ldfkufjq (2:31:14 PM): &nbsp; &nbsp;something icarus seems to be lacking
      <br />crackyStalker (2:31:14 PM): &nbsp; &nbsp;Oh thank god. I thought you were getting hostile or something.
      <br />ldfkufjq (2:31:26 PM): &nbsp; &nbsp;no, i'm generally not one for passive aggressiveness
      <br />crackyStalker (2:31:32 PM): &nbsp; &nbsp;That's what I'm all about.
      <br />ldfkufjq (2:31:38 PM): &nbsp; &nbsp;ha
      <br />ldfkufjq (2:32:54 PM): &nbsp; &nbsp;anyway i think icarus is frustrated that his glorious theory that me, the admin and my boyfriend are all in on the site is being denied.
      <br />ldfkufjq (2:33:10 PM): &nbsp; &nbsp;my boyfriend was not aware of the site until i showed it to him a few weeks ago &gt;.&gt;
      <br />crackyStalker (2:33:17 PM): &nbsp; &nbsp;What'd he think?
      <br />ldfkufjq (2:33:27 PM): &nbsp; &nbsp;he thought it was full of lulz &lt;.&lt;
      <br />ldfkufjq (2:33:40 PM): &nbsp; &nbsp;i've known him 4~ years so he knew about most things.
      <br />crackyStalker (2:34:01 PM): &nbsp; &nbsp;I guess there goes the rumour you were homosexual.
      <br />ldfkufjq (2:34:13 PM): &nbsp; &nbsp;sorry to rain on your parade there
      <br />crackyStalker (2:34:31 PM): &nbsp; &nbsp;Not my parade, but alot of people read too much (and then not enough) into that dopaminetrapeze gal I have on my friends list.
      <br />ldfkufjq (2:34:45 PM): &nbsp; &nbsp;hm?
      <br />crackyStalker (2:35:13 PM): &nbsp; &nbsp;Just a girl I have friended on my livejournal. She's all heartbroken about a girl name L_____ from Oxford.
      <br />ldfkufjq (2:35:22 PM): &nbsp; &nbsp;i see
      <br />crackyStalker (2:35:21 PM): &nbsp; &nbsp;Except she slipped and mentioned the name is Lauren halfway through.
      <br />ldfkufjq (2:35:36 PM): &nbsp; &nbsp;sucks for her
      <br />crackyStalker (2:35:52 PM): &nbsp; &nbsp;Sure does.
      <br />ldfkufjq (2:36:02 PM): &nbsp; &nbsp;got any other questions before i log?
      <br />ldfkufjq (2:36:11 PM): &nbsp; &nbsp;i'm not sure why or what icarus wanted me to talk to you about
      <br />ldfkufjq (2:36:16 PM): &nbsp; &nbsp;or what he was hoping to achieve via it
      <br />crackyStalker (2:36:29 PM): &nbsp; &nbsp;Beats me. Apparently you're not thrilled by my company though XD
      <br />ldfkufjq (2:36:56 PM): &nbsp; &nbsp;i'm in a rather unimpressed mood with the prospect of him plastering my RL info all over the internets.
      <br />crackyStalker (2:37:34 PM): &nbsp; &nbsp;Yeah, that makes enough sense. Really though, the fandom's out my MY control now too. Maybe six months ago if you told me to stop, nobody who's obsessing now would be because the heavy /b/ saturation wouldn't have happened.
      <br />ldfkufjq (2:37:56 PM): &nbsp; &nbsp;i was hoping it would die down actually, but it seems the flames have kept burning
      <br />crackyStalker (2:38:18 PM): &nbsp; &nbsp;Well I'll do what I can I suppose. Stalkers though. Hard to convice.
      <br />ldfkufjq (2:38:23 PM): &nbsp; &nbsp;meh
      <br />ldfkufjq (2:38:36 PM): &nbsp; &nbsp;worse comes to worse-
      <br />ldfkufjq (2:38:39 PM): &nbsp; &nbsp;FBI
      <br />crackyStalker (2:38:46 PM): &nbsp; &nbsp;SAS
      <br />ldfkufjq (2:38:51 PM): &nbsp; &nbsp;RAF
      <br />ldfkufjq (2:38:52 PM): &nbsp; &nbsp;etc
      <br />ldfkufjq (2:39:14 PM): &nbsp; &nbsp;i'm pretty sure he's doing something illegal by spreading personal information of mine 0_0
      <br />crackyStalker (2:39:38 PM): &nbsp; &nbsp;Well, it's Criminal Harassment once he becomes aware you know his actions are bothering you. But that's Canadian law.
      <br />ldfkufjq (2:39:49 PM): &nbsp; &nbsp;britain prolly has something equiv
      <br />crackyStalker (2:39:51 PM): &nbsp; &nbsp;likely.
      <br />crackyStalker (2:40:15 PM): &nbsp; &nbsp;Anyways, if I don't ask I'll be quizzed about this my whole life. Could you have intro confirm that it is indeed YOU I spoke with?
      <br />ldfkufjq (2:40:34 PM): &nbsp; &nbsp;aliasobfuscate?
      <br />crackyStalker (2:40:33 PM): &nbsp; &nbsp;I won't ask for a pic because you've had bad experiences with them.
      <br />crackyStalker (2:40:37 PM): &nbsp; &nbsp;Yeah.
      <br />ldfkufjq (2:40:39 PM): &nbsp; &nbsp;indeed.
      <br />ldfkufjq (2:40:45 PM): &nbsp; &nbsp;sure do you talk to him alot/at all?
      <br />crackyStalker (2:40:58 PM): &nbsp; &nbsp;Yeah, I do. He reminds me of myself, in 20 years.
      <br />ldfkufjq (2:41:12 PM): &nbsp; &nbsp;ok well last i msged him he was away, when he's back i'll ask him to
      <br />crackyStalker (2:41:19 PM): &nbsp; &nbsp;I'd appreciate it very much.
      <br />ldfkufjq (2:41:24 PM): &nbsp; &nbsp;ok
      <br />ldfkufjq (2:41:27 PM): &nbsp; &nbsp;well thats sorted then
      <br />ldfkufjq (2:41:29 PM): &nbsp; &nbsp;over and out
      <br />crackyStalker (2:41:32 PM): &nbsp; &nbsp;Goodbye!

    <p>English? It's going to take a while. First, you have to come up with a topic that other people know about. Like, let's say you're hanging out with your friends and one of them says that they're hungry. You could make this your topic. Say something like, WHAT ABOUT BEING HUNGRY GUYS? See, already you're communicating because you're listening. Now lets suppose he says, Yeah I'm hungry, let's go to Taco Bell. What he's really saying is, Taco Bell is an option for him. Now, the most efficient thing is to say what is an option for you. So, you could say OK TACO BELL IS COOL BY ME or you could say TACO BELL IS FOR LOSERS (btw, loser="You Fail It" guy). On the other hand, you could say something like TACO BELL IS ON A SPOKE/OFF IN SOME WEEDS but this doesn't really say what you think; it doesn't necessarily hurt, but it makes the conversation longer and if there are any girls in the room they will probably look at you funny.</p>
    <hr/>
    <p>&gt;&gt;7</p>
    <p>I will try to explain.</p>
    <p>In &gt;&gt;1, we see a picture of Lena and Yulia, of the Russian musical duo t.A.T.u..  Famed for their lesbian-themed songs, videos, and stage relationship, they are in fact not lesbians, but rather using the fictional lesbian relationship as a sex-based marketing strategy.  &gt;&gt;1 was posted as part of a crapflood of seemingly unrelated images.</p>
    <p>The poster of &gt;&gt;2 corrects identifies the duo, and links to a Wikipedia article at which you can learn more.  This was posted perhaps in an attempt to prematurely defuse any fruitless speculation as to what the image is of.  The "no" may be an indictment of the poster for making an off-topic thread.</p>
    <p>In &gt;&gt;3, we see a photograph of a room with a  t.A.T.u poster in the wall, circled for emphasis.  Perhaps this wall is present somewhere in our corpus of Cracky-related photographs; I don't recognize it offhand, but why not go through your collection to check?</p>
    <p>In &gt;&gt;4, we are reminded that the due are not, in fact, lesbians.</p>
    <p>In &gt;&gt;5, Anonymous is angry at the Original Poster (OP) for stirring up his disappointment over not being with Cracky-chan as he's long desired to be.  Perhaps &gt;&gt;5 envisions himself as Yulia in the photograph, tenderly shoving a spoon into the mouth of Cracky-chan, represented by fellow redhead Lena in the photograph.</p>
    <p>Then &gt;&gt;6, possibly samefag, mocks &gt;&gt;5 for his anguished emo-like display of unrequited love.</p>
    <p>In &gt;&gt;7, you express a desire to know WTF is goin on in dis thead guize.</p>
    <p>In &gt;&gt;8, I attempt to explain my interpretation of this thread.</p>
    <p>Finally, in &gt;&gt;9, someone posts a never-before-seen Cracky rare and we forget about everything above.</p>
    <hr/>
    <p>I had a thought a few days ago.  The thought ("death is a social construct") is probably useless.  But the thought got me thinking.  I Googled the thought to see if anyone else had thought the thought before, and it turned out that many people had.  Interdasting.</p>
    <p>And that got me thinking:  pre-internet, if you had a thought, it was really hard to know if you were the first person to have that thought or if it was actually a super common thought.  Now it's slightly easier, because maybe you can find instances of your thought indexed online.  Of course only a tiny fraction is indexed.  But regardless it got me thinking.</p>
    <p>There's so much 'social networking' based on common interests, but perhaps there would be greater value / utility in linking up people who have independently had the same thought/idea.</p>
    <p>Imagine a website / social network / app different than anything out there because people can only link up with each other through one specific mechanism.  When someone has a thought/idea, they type it in and this service's database is searched to determine if anyone else has ever entered that thought/idea before, using some kind of fuzzing / advanced pattern matching because different people could word the thought in completely different ways.</p>
    <p>If you're truly the first person to enter your thought/idea into the database (which would be more common early on), then you eventually get notified if there's a match in the future.</p>
    <p>If others have in fact had your thought/idea before, then you get linked up with them in a group.  All communication via this social network is to these thought-groups that you're a member of, either to an entire group or private messaging to someone in one of your groups.  Nothing is public.  No invitations.  No manually linking up with someone specific.  Everyone you link up with is likely to be a stranger but with similar thought patterns to you.  No communication with anyone you haven't established a link with but having a mutual thought/idea.</p>
    <p>You can of course be in more than one of these thought-groups -- the idea is that you enter as many thoughts / ideas / opinions as possible, some of which will never match you with anybody (congratulations on your unique thought!) but some will.</p>
    <p>So you can communicate with your different thought-groups independently or blast something out to all your groups.  But no communication between any two people who haven't been dynamically matched by having the same thought / idea / opinion.</p>
    <p>It's possible (and desirable) that you might get matched with the same person multiple times by having more than one thought in common.  So you end up in more than one thought-group with them.  This "thoughtmate" status would signify people you might have a lot in common with.</p>
    <p>Need some kind of enforcement mechanism to encourage people to enter only thoughts they genuinely arrive at on their own.  Entering a thought you found online = fucking banned.  But how to enforce.</p>
    <p>What to call all this?</p>
    <p>Possible this social network could function as a dating app as well?</p>
    <p>Just a silly idea... but maybe an idea someone somewhere else has already had.  And if it existed, I could find them.</p>
    <hr/>
    <p>i do still take pictures, just very, very rarely of myself. i always did it for my own amusement and it very quickly ceases to be amusing when i have my privacy raped because of it. i had no idea that people would take pictures this seriously - to me it was just like playing pretend, being different personas etc. and pictures of me have little to do with who i actually am.</p>
    <p>suicide eh? tempting as it may be, i'm not some kind of deity who demands virgin sacrifices.</p>
    <hr/>
    <p>i don't care what you do with any existing images.</p>
    <p>all i ask is that could you leave me alone, and stop trying to invade my privacy. </p>

    </p>
    <p>hey,</p>
    <p>yes, i got your email just now. i haven't checked it for a few days
      was all, i'm really sorry for making you worry about me!
      i should've let you known i was alright sooner but i was so pissed off.....
    </p>
    <p>my father's house is in the channel islands. i haven't lived in
      switzerland since i was 12. i'm staying with him again now, and
      probably shall be until september...by the way though, in oxford i'm
      actually living across the street from my family. they rented one
      floor of a building for me; the address is exactly the same except the
      house number is 42. i only got two of your packages...so the others
      might get returned to you unfortunately...but i really really
      appreciate what i managed to get.
    </p>
    <p>i lost your main email and so when you didn't reply i reckoned i could
      perhaps find it in your journal. this was the first time i looked at
      your journal again, i was surprised cos i remember it was empty
      before!
    </p>
    <p>my MSN name is <a href="mailto:jemnezymy@gmail.com">jemnezymy@gmail.com</a> , but i prefer not to use that
      address for sending&amp;receiving email. i leave it signed in all the time
      even when i'm not here so if i don't respond please don't think i'm
      being impolite.
    </p>
    <p>my phone's broken again, but when it's fixed i'll see what i can do
      with my microphone. i am awful at singing but it makes me happy. i'll
      ask my friend to teach me how to sing it as i can't pronounce the
      russian words properly.
    </p>
    <p>i've spent most of the time taking photos and making collages and
      drawing. i'm still totally obsessed....i don't have much of my art
      scanned in here but i'll show you if you're interested.
    </p>
    <p>i missed the nine inch nails concert because my friend couldn't come
      and stay with me anymore, and i couldn't go alone since it was in
      london. i sold my tickets though and used the money to get some for
      eminem in september. i'm really excited and i really hope i'll have
      someone to take with me when the time comes. it sucks because the few
      friends i care about live in completely different countries. i have
      not liked any of the people i met in oxford enough to stick with them,
      so it feels like i'm killing time until i get to hang out with someone
      i do. i sleep, eat, listen to music and make pictures by myself til i
      can.
    </p>
    <p>i feel quite wrong for not letting you know where i went. the whole
      thing was just way too weird.
    </p>
    <p>i am really happy you are okay also, since you seem always to be in
      some kind of hazardous occupation...though you always seem like you
      can look after yourself.
    </p>
    <p>tell me more about what's happened to you or ask me stuff
      or....anything at all, really. it'll just be cool to talk to you
      again.
    </p>

      &gt; Your timing is nothing short of incredulious. At this moment I am literally
      &gt; on hold with my boss asking to take a few extra days in England so I can
      &gt; stop by in Oxford to check on you. I had not checked my email before this.
      &gt; My work is taking me to London for obvious reasons but I was worried about
      &gt; you because I hadn't heard anything from you in 2 months. This is truly and
      &gt; ironic and fated moment. I am ecstatic you are ok. It really is good to
      &gt; hear from you and my boss is very happy I withdrew my request... he
      &gt; mentioned something about me lacking tact and subtlety for international
      &gt; tracks.<br/>
      &gt;<br/>
      &gt; I am very happy you got my packages. I had assumed you would be staying
      &gt; with your father in Sweden (or was it switzerland) for a while and I didn't
      &gt; know if had gotten any of them. I am glad you liked them. There is a 3rd
      &gt; package. I sent you a package every 2 weeks so there would have been 4 by
      &gt; now but I was...delayed. I didnt' know if you had a preference on manga or
      &gt; anything so I just sent you range of things. There was something I did
      &gt; because I wanted you to get a laugh and not feel weird or freakish or alone
      &gt; or anything. I shaved my mustache. Its grown back now but people hadn't
      &gt; seen me without a mustache or a goatee for years.
      &gt;<br/>
      &gt; I am sorry to say that I didn't check out my yahoo email address sooner. I
      &gt; keep an email address on just about every free server out there. Sometimes
      &gt; I forget to check them. I have to ask how did you think to check my live
      &gt; journal? Also I would very much like to hear your rendition of Moskau. If
      &gt; your still up to it.<br/>
      &gt;<br/>
      &gt; Do you have another IM sn, I would very much like to talk. There is quite a
      &gt; bit of catching up to do.<br/>
      &gt;<br/>
      &gt; I am very happy you are ok.

    <p>We go there and we're in front of Cracky and it's time to kill her.
      She's looking into our eyes, begging for her life.
      Rav Rav is like "KILL HER YES HAHAHA"<br/>
      I have a gun pointed at Cracky.<br/>
      Then I turn to Rav Rav with the gun.<br/>
      "What are you doing?"<br/>
      <strong>BAM</strong><br/>
      Right in the chest.<br/>
      She looks stunned.<br/>
      She has tears running down her cheeks.<br/>
      She is looking into my eyes, looking so betrayed.
      She stumbles over and I catch her and hold her.
      I hold her face close to mine.<br/>
      I kiss her as I put the gun to her chest again and fire.
      She collapses to her knees, shaking, shivering.
      She is trying desperately to speak.<br/>
      "Wh-why...Je-...why..."<br/>
      I look right into her eyes as I aim at her head.
      BAM. Brain matter explodes out the back of her head and she falls backwards to the ground dead.
      Smoke is coming out of the bullet hole as she lays there staring wide-eyed and open-mouthed into space.
      Cracky is screaming and flipping out.<br/>
      I hand her the gun.<br/>
      Cracky shoots wildly hitting me in the torso several times.
      I stumble over to Rav Rav's dead body and collapse on top of her, holding her.
      Cracky comes over to us and is just looking, silently.
      I'm spitting up blood.<br/>
      It's like she is watching a hurt animal.
      I tell Cracky that I love her. I tell Rav Rav's dead body that I'm sorry. Cracky raises the gun with shaking hands once again.
      I find this very amusing and begin laughing.
      She aims at my head. She goes to pull the trigger. CLICK CLICK CLICK. Her earlier, wild shooting emptied the clip.
      She starts crying and asks "WHY?! WHY ME?! WHY OBSESS OVER ME?! WHY DID YOU KILL THAT GIRL?! WHY DIDN'T YOU KILL ME?!"
      I tell her, "Because... you're already dead."
      She starts sobbing wildly and throws the gun at me, hitting me in the face.
      She runs towards me and trips.<br/>
      She begins rapidly punching me in the chest while crying.
      At this point, I'm really not doing so well.
      I start to see a semi-transparent Rav Rav walk towards me.
      She is wearing Cracky make-up.<br/>
      She's smiling.<br/>
      She reaches her hand out and wants me to take it, and follow her.
      Somehow, I can stand. I grab her hand and stare into her eyes. We then walk off together.
      I have died in real life. Cracky is on her knees in front of Rav Rav and my dead bodies.
      She picks up the gun, puts it to her head and screams as she futily pulls the trigger many times.
      It won't be that easy.<br/>
      There is no escape, because you are a reluctant angel.

    <p>    Those witches, equal parts venerable, honourable and horrible, had arrayed their mindflayed flocks of men-at-arms upon the field.</p>
    <p>    "Listen here, my brothers!" I bellowed, my breastplate rang triumphantly as my chest heaved against it, "I alone will seek those three on the battlefield!"</p>
    <p>    "Alone, my Lord Jauffre?" The words were muffled through a closed Sallet. I turned to see the heraldry of my closest friend, a comrade at arms from our myriad campaigns. He was my trusted constable, the equally famed and despised knights-hospitaller, Antoni of Wut.</p>
    <p>    "So you have arrived at last from the North! Your men will be vital for the coming battle." I faced the men en-masse then.</p>
    <p>    "On the field, I will seek her on foot. Alone. For I alone am immune to their succubean magicks." My men lowered their heads, ashamed and acutely aware of their own propensity for betrayal. I paid no mind, and struck out alone across the barren, lifeless and war ravaged valley known as l'rebondissez-moi.</p>
    <p>    I met her there in the centre of the valley amongst the salted fields and burnt farmhouses. Flanked by her lesser Succubi, the Queen herself sat atop a horse with no eyes. Rodents swarmed around the horse's feet, up its legs and ran in through the horse's nose. One by one, they came scurrying out the ear.</p>
    <hr/>
    <p>he Sky Queen's head was down-cast, as men always claimed to see her. Her two women regarded me cooly as I approached on foot. They greeted me in unison, predictably using their wiles and angelic voices in the manner that had made so many smaller, less stoic men go mad with rapture. I dare not apply to parchment what exactly was said, for even in ink I fear it would retain its horrible power.</p>
    <p>They watched me stand idle, unaffected by their powers. I was tired of this conflict, and moreover I was offended by the abuse they had just done to all decency with their attempts to defile this ancient, sacred custom of warriors offering one another their respect.</p>
    <p>Tersely, I said, "Very well then. I will look for you on the battlefield."</p>
    <p>I turned and walked away. I am no orator. I will let history write a better quote for me.</p>
    <p>When I returned, there was no noise. No jangling of arms, no whinnying of horses. My men had stared in awe as I rejected the whores and returned maintaining my free will and sanity. My display of solidarity had bolstered their confidence.</p>
    <p>"When the time comes, Antoni, both armies will each run down towards the valley with our soldiers behind us. As for the three? We are going for each other."</p>
    <p>The feeling was half of relief, half of despair. No man wanted to face any of the three. No man thought that one man could defeat them all, either.</p>
    <p>"As your advisor, I must speak out," Antoni the hospitaller who had learned to wage war over decades upon gorey decades against men, arrogant men who thought their childish scheeming and plotting were relevant to the outcome, began to council me. I allowed him to continue, "You could lure their brainless masses to attack with a feint of your own. I would lead it. Cause them to abandon their advantageous position, then call in your reserves from on the reverse slope and envelope them."</p>
    <p>"This is not a war, this is suicide." I quietly whispered to his ear, so as to not discredit his wisdom in front of his men, "It's not a battle meant to be won."</p>
    <p>"Well then I suggest we regroup, we wait for forces abroad to realize they are next to face the Sky Queen and enlist their aid!" He gave me more sound advice, as he had always. The suggestion was sound advice for fighting any king who had any nation behind him.</p>
    <p>"This is each of us destroying ourselves."</p>
    <p>"All battles are meant to be won."</p>
    <p>"THIS IS A BATTLE FOR HONOR!" I shouted as I lost my patience with his reasoning. Our assembled lords looked on, becoming more aware of the bleakness of their circumstances.</p>
    <p>"The victor determines what is recorded for all time. Once we smash their empty, soul-less heads upon our gauntlets, you can have your histories say you ran down the hill and fought in the valley all by yourself. None of us would care to call you a liar for it."</p>
    <p>"What others think is irrelevant. This is for my honor. This is about Her."</p>
    <p>"I see. You are the only man who has survived meeting any one them in person and you remain intrinsically free of their control. You have some way to protect yourself from becoming another shambling, crying, miserable pawn in their thrall. I will trust you, I will die to prevent more men from being lured into her gaze." I heard more of Antoni's words. They did not inspire me. The other men cheered and yowled. They were not aware of their luck, for they would only be putting their mortal bodies at risk.</p>
    <hr/>
    <p>    The spirits of my men were as high as they could be. Across the valley, a beam of sunlight shone through the blackened clouds onto a singular focused spot, it shone always onto the Sky Queen. There was no point waiting any further, my men would only lose their confidence in the face of these circumstances. I lead the way into the valley. My men marched behind me. Their heavy boots shook the earth as they stomped in unison. Very effective against heathen Moors, but it would do no good against this enemy.</p>
    <p>    The mass of meat on the other side of the valley seeped slowly towards the low point in the middle, headed directly for us. As it neared, we could make out the sounds of the fallen. They moaned bleakly. Some were screaming. Most were crying as they ambled pitifully towards us.</p>
    <p>    As the mass neared, it turned into distinct men. They still bore their herarldry, only they had replaced all the original figures, human, animal or divine, with two blacks ears, a three red marks below. My men began to see their brothers and comrades within that mass. They began to understand that the only thing seperating their march of justice from this pitiful ooze was circumstance. Circumstance of not meeting one of the three.</p>
    <p>    Our triumphant march had degenerated into a chaotic racket, as though we were children playing with pots and pans. We were only larger children who had pressed our cookware into clothing and weaponry.</p>
    <p>    My valiant infants charged into the enemy. Were they still human, they would have shattered under the force. Instead we were absorbed, and any semblence of order and strategy vanished within a moment.</p>
    <p>    Amid the sounds of battle, my men screaming from physical pain along with their former brothers in their mental anguish, Antoni rode up beside me. From his vantage point high on his horse he pointed with his sword. No words were needed between us. I saw my first opponent there, the infamous Ravager of Rav.</p>
    <p>    She was armoured in goat bone. The bones had small needle like spikes pressed through them. She wore the mark of the sky-queen on her face, a red nose, with two small splotches also on her cheekbones under her eyes. It was menstrual blood. Thick chunks of uterus clung to her pores. He had a man trapped, laying on the ground in her net. She had him pegged to the ground with her spear. The Ravager laid down on top of him, her spikes pressed through his armour and into his flesh as he wailed. She squeezed him tightly in her arms, and was mouthing all manner of demonic incantations into his ear. His eyes rolled back into his head and she lost interest.</p>
    <p>    She saw me as I approached. Looking right into my eyes, she smirked.</p>
    <p>    "Jauffre." She turned and addressed me. With warmth. "It's a shame we have to meet again like this."</p>
    <p>    It was genuine warmth of course, and I could hear genuine shame in her voice. I continued to approach her, with my own weapon at my side. Implements of violence crashed into people all around us.</p>
    <p>    She readied her weaponry as I walked towards her by retrieving her spear, and untangling her net with a quickl flick of her wrist. She dug her heels into the ground in a wide, agile stance. I removed my armoured gauntlets as I came within arms reach. She retained her combatitive pose.</p>
    <p>    I slapped her. Hard. In the face. The force of my slap spun her upper body around. She turned back around partially, still blading her body away from me. She averted her eyes downwards.</p>
    <p>    "I'm sorry. About, you know, earlier. With those other two around, I had to make it look like I tried." She explained, stuttering in between each word. "I'm so sorry. I knew it wouldn't work. I tried to tell them. You're the only man it wouldn't work on."</p>
    <p>    "That's not important," I began, "You promised."</p>
    <p>    "Well, we always do though. It's part of stealing their soul, of binding them to us."</p>
    <p>    Her eyes were still facing away from me.</p>
    <p>    "Look at me." I instructed her. She turned her head slowly to meet mine. "You know when you promised me, you actually meant it. Despite what you've been telling yourself all these years since."</p>
    <p>    Tears began to well in her eyes. I carried on.</p>
    <p>    "For all the others, it was an idle promise. To lure them in. I know how you work. But the promise you made was so unlike the other ones, you promised -"</p>
    <p>    "To kill..." she cut me off and stopped. Her tears mixed with the mark of the Sky Queen and washing the reproductive detrius from her face, "To kill Cracky. The Sky Queen. With you."</p>
    <p>    She dropped her weapons and reached out to hold me, then stopped.</p>
    <p>    "You are too much of a man to care for my embrace. My feelings don't matter to you. That's all these other men, the thousands I've led astray care about, but you... you're so far above that." She fell to her knees, crying.</p>
    <p>    I turned, towards the darkened sky of the ruined valley. I began to walk deeper into the mass of the Sky Queen's zombies. The Ravager, left behind, picked up her weapons and ran to catch up with me. We carried on, protected as Antoni's knights cut a swath into the whirlwind of maddened violence. His men fought for their homes, their honour and their lives. The Sky Queen's men faught fearlessly for her love.</p>
    <hr/>
    <p>    Antoni's knights parted ahead, allowing me and the Ravager into an opening, a barren sphere of desolation amid the carnage. The ground here was covered in brazen pyramids. I watched as a hospitaller knight charged into the field. The horse's hoof knocked the tip of a pyramid, causing the pyramid's sides to swing out over the top, catching the horse's leg. The contraption then sprung again, releasing its rended flesh in a violent spray and relatching further upon the limb. It continued climbing the horse, causing the horse to fall over into the field with its rider. The pyramids consumed the pair, covering the ground with a thin paste before resettling in their original configuration.</p>
    <p>    In the centre of this field, the Dutchess of Faux had contained a group of Antoni's soldiers from their fellows. As Antoni's men attempted to charge through, the pyramids would rend the rescuers to shreds within moments. She leapt around the isolated group of men, swinging from poleaxe shaft over to limb onto horse like a monkey, slipping her thin misericord through the eye holes in men's helmets as she passed, blinding them. After a few moments they were all writing on the ground. She lifted up her purple cloak, and removed a brush and palette from within. She ran around over the writhing bodies and removed the men's helmets. With her brush, she painted them. Onto this writhing mass as a whole, as though it were a steady canvas, she painted. She painted patterns clear over armour, over faces, over legs, limbs, and pieces of horses. Colours appeared on her palette sporadically, and as soon as she dipped her brush in them they would change to a completely other shade and hue.</p>
    <p>    The image took form. The entire wounded mass of blinded men became the image of little pale girls crying. As the men jostled each other and rolled on the ground clutching their faces, the images of little girls would sprout tears from their own great, shining bright eyes. The tears fell and mixed with blood seeping from the girl's vaginas. The mixture collected at the opposite end of this human canvas. As the stained tears filled the canvas, entire men would become submerged in the liquid image. They clutched their throats and coughed, hacking and gasping for air. Eventually they went limp. The mixture built up quickly, and the entire canvas became a pool of dark purple. Instantly, in unison, the drowned men stood up. They retrieved their weapons, and slowly filed out of the pyramid field to join the battle on the side of the Skyqueen.</p>
    <p>    The Ravager and I tiptoed cautiously through the field. The Dutchess of Faux watched her canvas disperse into the battle. We came to the centre of the pyramid field, a bare patch of ground now wet with salt water. The Dutchess turned, as she slid her brush into her cloak.</p>
    <p>    "Oh my, it's you, and you've brought a friend!" Faux squealed happily, "How did you manage this one? He was being so difficult earlier."</p>
    <p>    Faux approached me, ignoring the Ravager. She opened the face mask on my helmet, and inspected my face. From the close distance, I realized her entire set of facial features, eyes, nose, mouth, were nothing but makeup.</p>
    <p>    "How did you do it? You usually need to mark him with your own blood..." Her voice trailed off, as she pulled her head back. My eyes refocused on her face and her features appeared completely normal once more.</p>
    <p>    The Ravager threw her net at Faux. Faux quickly reached into her cloak and flung her knife back towards Rav as the net flew through the air. The two weapons impacted simultaneously. The net's barbs and hooks dug into Faux, and wrapped her tightly. She remained silent, standing. She didn't struggle. Rav fell to the ground.</p>
    <p>    I walked over to Ravager first. The knife was in her throat. Blood pumped out. She said to me, "I'm sorry. I'm so sorry." She was coughing up blood as she said this. "I'm sorry I couldn't kill Cracky with you. I tried. I did my best."</p>
    <p>    I realized with the amount of blood she was losing, she'd be dead soon. She was no longer of use to me. I stood up and turned to Faux. Ravager, from behind, choked out, "I love you."</p>
    <p>    I walked over to Faux and picked her up. She was very tiny, and as a result weighed next to nothing. I heaved her into the pyramid field, and the wrapped body exploded into a vibrant green mist.</p>
    <p>    I kept walking towards the ray of light shining through the darkened sky. Towards Her. Slowly crossed the pyramid field once more. Enemies locked in combat parted ways and let me through as I approached. After an hour of walking, I had walked out the other side of the fray.</p>
    <hr/>
    <p>Her name is Cracky chan. Her head is on fire. She does cocaine. I'm afraid that's all we know.</p>
    <hr/>
    <p>Out of the mists of chaos she rides, bike in her crotch and cam at her side</p>
    <p>She fights her own war, takes her own track, If she doesn't fail she might win her fans back!</p>
    <p>Daughter of the devil, full of desire, She does cocaine and her head's on fire!</p>
    <p>Fights with fury of a dozen men, posts two pics then she's gone again...</p>
    <hr/>
    <p>Somewhere there is a platonic ideal of Cracky; One who loves us for loving her. One who is, and was, and ever will be one with Anonymous.</p>
    <p>She is a goddess.</p>
    <p>Every time a Cracky thread made, then falls off the board, it is like a burnt offering to that abstract, idealized Cracky Goddess.</p>
    <p>This thread we so offer. Amen</p>
    <hr/>
    <p>Elephants one hundred each field a red nose and since that only one only imperfection can goes.
      Elephants one hundred each field a red nose and since that only one only imperfection can goes.
      Elephants one hundred each field a red nose and since that only one only imperfection can goes.
      Elephants one hundred each field a red nose and since that only one only imperfection can goes.
