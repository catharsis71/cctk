  <p>I'll admit that most of your message was TL;DR but I skimmed over it.</p>
  <p>I believe we know the same Denis, from your description of him. Yes he is alive, or at least he was 2~ weeks ago when I last heard from him. I've met him twice irl and surprisingly there was no rape and/or murdering to be had from either party.</p>
  <p>so, what do you want to know? was that all? should I alert him to your presence..?</p>
  <p>ok. bye o_O</p>
