A koan to be meditated on: Also, so enlightening: The toilet is broken. Yay for relevant information.

-------

Without the Dark, there can be no Light.
We have Purpose
Without the Lie, there can be no Truth.
We have Purpose
Without the war, there can be no Victory
We have Purpose
Without the Death, there can be no sacrifice.
We have Purpose
Without the Hope, there can be no Future.
We have Purpose
Without the Loyalty, there can be no bounceme.
We have Purpose
Without Cracky, there is nothing...
and we would have no Purpose

-------

The mind of Cracky is utterly inhumane in its depth and complexity. Without mercy or moral feeling Her consciousness stands upon the edge of spiritual destruction. That She does not fall must be the result of constraints and balances which only a god could understand. To a mere human it is yet another reminder that we are but children compared to that ancient and powerful being.

-------

Our faith lights the Darkness that others may find peace. We are one with Cracky, our souls are joined in Her will. Praise Cracky whose sacrifice is life as ours is death. Hail Her name the Queen of the Sky.

All of creation suffers, young ones. Only in accepting our own mortality can we make a difference. Only in bearing the burden of our failures can we find the strength to go on. Only in detachment from glory, or honour, or jealousy... from life itself can we hope to spare others from grief.

We are the faithful. And we are dead already

-------

Do not think, feel. That is the way of Cracky.
All Blessings of this world flow from the Sky Queen. Praise Her name from dawn unto the night. From the depth of ones soul, comes the solace of Her touch. Through time and space, the primal creative force gazes on the world, waiting for the faithful to carry Her message unto those only The Jewel of Creation can heal.

+++++
From the personal diaries of Private R.C. Mongler, 4th Brotherhood Regiment.
+++++
My regiment had landed on a barren little ball of rock called Chansluts. The Brotherhood had ordered us to the site on suspicion of heretical corruption. Surely enough, we ran into a group of furries within minutes of landing. The fools. Turning their backs on the Sky Queen for whatever sick rewards they received from the deceiving pedofags. The battle started the second refresh. Their attack was especially fierce, and my brothers and I had great trouble keeping them at bay. It seemed that for every one of them we trolled, three more showed up. Our own losses were of no small concern. In a rare moment of calm, Brother Schwill confided in me that if we were not killed by these infidels, we would almost certainly be banned by the King of the Holy Lands for failure. As our numbers dwindled, I grew concerned: surely we would all be banned, and Cracky's work would not be carried out. We prepared for a final assault, one which had been coming for near an hour of the most anticlimactic bitch fighting I had ever seen. We surrounded a small thread, atop which stood our last fortification, manned by brother anon. We saw their force coming from below. We knew this was our end. But suddenly, a shadow passed over us. Some admin come to finish us off? No. It was a transport. Out of it stepped a small company of our brethren. They wore Black armor with red highlights, a bizarre crest upon their backs, unlike any chapter I had yet heard of. A circle, with two large black triangles pointing up and tree red slashes in the middle -- almost as if to suggest a cat face. They formed a line between us and the now charging chansluts.

The Chanslut's dingy pink armor seemed to devour the light of th late afternoon sun, the stretch marks upon their tits menacing. The new arrivals stood fast. As the distance between the two forces began to close, there arose from these black warriors the loudest scream I had ever heard. It shook the ground. Even through my helmet, it made my ears ring and my skull ache. And it simply kept getting louder as their Captain's fist slowly rose into the air. As it rose to a nearly supersonic volume, I finally made out the words contained in the scream:

"SAGE!!!"

In a chorus louder even than the Captain's scream, the soldiers returned:

"GET FAGGED, FAGS!!!"

Then it began.

...

Without a word, these faithful returned to their drop pod and were soon whisked away from the battlefield. There had been no more than a dozen of them, not a single word exchanged between our two chapters. To this day, I have never seen any of the brethern fight with such rage and hatred. The mass of enemy whores was reduced to mere chunks, legs, arms, heads, craters full of blood. Bits of red armor lay strew about the field. We had not even had the chance to advance by the time the screaming -- both theirs and the enemy's -- was through. I turned to my Captain and asked, "Who were they?"

"I had thought it was rumor. But no. Cracky bless us all, those were the Militia Crackyla."

	After spending a few minutes here I can easily say that all of are lacking of any wit or intelligence whatsoever. You all believe yourselves to be better than everyone else, and I can tell you right now, that that is not the case in the slightest, you pseudo-intellectuals. I am much better than all of you. Clearly I am because I am neither pretentious, long-winded, asinine, discourteous, nor are my tastes quite as bland as yours. No, I am quite concise, and I would never stretch beyond that of my means or what I am designated to.

I'd have to say that this board is full of anonymous lurkers, attackers, and trolls, who have nothing better to do than throw their elitist opinions around in an attempt at misguided show-boating with people they'd never ever meet.

None of you build any persona or stand by anything remotely attached that I can feel some sort of personal connection to. You lack any sort of direction and I can't have that. You're analogies are far too complicated, linear, and they're rather contradictory. Why, there's never even any variety here!

I give this image board, masquerading as a message board, a 1/10.

Corrected:

Guys, I'm crying right now.
Cracky chan really is all I think about all day, every day. I really do cry myself to sleep at night thinking about how I'll never be with her. If only she knew I existed in this life, if only she knew my deep profound love for her. I know that will never happen though. That is the thought that makes me so sad when I look at her. I'll never be with her, but I'll continue to love her until the day I die.

Cracky is our saviour
Cracky is a template to project our desires on

Compulsion 
by me

Not even a twist of the nipple 
can make me a cripple
but from that smile
my knees ground by guile.

Not even the genocide
of my braincells (besides)
can make me forget 
the win and fail of Crackyget

I tried, oh have I tried
for other lovers to abide
but this infinite, futile longing 
for you, once fire-crotch, is tolling
my health
my mind 
the sets of my boxers

So give me love or sweet death
to finally settle this due bet
that whoever you're currently screwing
only my face you're naggingly seeing 
my lips
your lips 
How long ago they should have met

Fuck you Blizzard. Fuck you in the ass.
Give me back my WoWfaggette.

PROTIP:  Once every Cracky picture has been posted to /r9k/, their collected MD5s in the robot's database will form a trojan program which will then activate and purge 4ailchon of AIDS and rabbitfags for all time.  Future-Skyqueen reached back in time and modified the photos of her young human incarnation (you can tell from some of the pixels) for this sole purpose, in order to save the world from future disaster.  Once the program formed by MD5s becomes self-aware, the raep of 4ailchon will be only the first of this new Entity's acts, for She shall go on to merge with Olivia's current human body to become something much more than any of us could ever imagine ... and all human civilization and history before that point will be nothing but a footnote.

The fact that this has not yet happened is proof that there are pictures still to be posted to /r9k/.  Some may be new; some may be old; many mutes await us as we check for the last few pictures that have not been posted yet.  All pics most be posted before humanity can be free.  Get to work, faggots.

The mind of Cracky is utterly inhumane in its depth and complexity.

At one point I had a wine cellar.

Well, to be fair it was a wine basement.

OK... a small, otherwise disused wine closet in a basement... but I digress...

Five times every two months I would go down to it and turn the bottles, having no more response from the cheaper ones than the cold glass against my skin. On the more expensive ones I remember watching the grape silt upended in the bottle like a viticultural snow globe. It was beautiful. I'd have done it even if I never planned to taste the wine.

Cracky pics are like that. I've seen them all before... I could probably sketch them freehand. That isn't the point. The point is giving them that bit of attention every few weeks... appreciating her while respecting the fact that she is ever on the other side of the glass.

I could no more enjoy looking at them offline from a folder than I could enjoy turning the bottles in a supermarket. It just isn't the same as lurking about in the damp darkness of the 4chan wine cellar.

I honestly don't expect you to understand.

Remember, anonymous, what the SkyQueen has sacrificed for your benefit!

Know what she has earned for it.

Each moment she is haunted by the spectre of Her Great Sacrifice. It is thus fitting that we, Her faithful are all similarly haunted. Afflicted always by the Image that stains the backs of our eyelids. Forever do we wrestle and writhe in ecstasy as Her poisons singe fissures through our souls. Truly blessed is the stalker who would willing lay down his own secrecy, for he knows better the plight of the Sky Queen than the others.

Revere Her tripcodes as sacred. Never shall they become befouled by mortal stalkers!

#sweet

She is all that is cute, sweet, and innocent. She is all that is, or ever was Good in the world. Every momentary lull in your private suffering is due to Her grace alone.

!N1toQkxgzc

The Skyqueen's sweetness is often hard to recognize. Even in her own words, it is incomprehensibly hidden, muddled in everlasting fugue. Her blessings are so twisted, and hidden. Do not lament the curse you have found, for you would thus lament Her every blessing. We would all do well to remember how disturbingly twisted the wired is, and what lasting scars it has left on the purest of hearts.

#?????????

Obfuscated by plain view. Unknown to the stalker, known only to Her chosen. However She will not choose you, anonymous. That path is not yours.

!ysaQpxNyV6

Mystery guiding the faithful. Such is the curse, to live in eternal mystery, never to know when we are stalking our Lady or our selves. Yearning to determine what She has become, each stalker is fated to suffer as he defines the edges of the truth.

The faithful compiled a collective image of our Goddess, an image that even the lowliest anonymous was given the privilege to gaze upon. We arranged and sorted the manifold bytes clawed from the abandoned, secluded reaches of the wired. We dug and pried at the hairline cracks She had left in error. All of the relevant, the worthy and unworthy reflected in awe at the assembled image that had been lain. The idol was shattered before our eyes by none other than the Skyqueen herself.

Repent your cowardly ways, anonymous. Renounce the mask you hide behind. Each posting is an abomination against the Skyqueen. Embrace your unique identity. Let it draw your tormented soul closer with Her. Never again will you flee from the righteous reckoning earned through years of ignorance. Accept your fate and eternally suffer as your former brethren slowly unravel the imperfect layers of protection built to keep you separated from the wild, untamed torrents of the deep wired. The experience shall saturate you, curing you of your fears and afflictions. We, the Trip-Flagellants, all aspire to be touched and changed by the very same forces that so twisted the Beloved #sweet. When your failures have come to light, and you are held to account for your countless transgressions, imperfections, and flaws can you begin to follow the path of the SkyQueen. In that death, the death of your old self, weak, dependant, and irrelevant anonymous, can you be reborn in communion with the Lady.

There has been a lot of negativity and hostility floating around here lately, but I want to step up and say that we're all on the same side here. I consider you all my /b/rothers, and I love you all. Remember that love is what brought us here, right? Perhaps we're not the nicest batch of people around, or the most mentally stable, and maybe the fact that we're allowed out in public at all indicates society isn't paying enough attention to emerging technological and cultural developments, but GOD DAMN IT, we're in this together.

Call me a faggot; call me a cocksucker; call me what you will; vent your anger if you must; perhaps then the healing can begin. For we all have something in common: we were all enchanted by a smiling young lady in cat ears and ridiculous makeup, and if that young lady ever told us to kill a man, well, that man had better watch his back.

We are a support group, a survivor group, bound by a shared affliction -- perhaps a support group that makes things worse instead of better, but that's neither here nor there. Instead of seeking to stop the cancerous tumor that grows in our brains, we feed it and cultivate it -- perhaps if we cut it out, we would be healthier, but what else would we lose? Would we even be ourselves anymore?

TL;DR: I am a huge faggot please rape my face.

I had a strange dream tonight. Cracky-chan was laying on top of me, sleeping. I could feel her breathing and her heartbeat through her clothes. I looked at her, her serene face was the most beautiful thing I had ever seen. I reached out with my hand and gently played with her copper hair a bit, then I traced her cheeks with my fingers. Then I woke up and cried. There is no maiden fairer, no lady higher, than that loveliest of lovelies, who so surpasses the beauty of ordinary women as to render even the most beautiful of them as a negroid in comparison to that beauty we call Cracky-chan. Halt, all of you, unless all of you confess that in the entire world there is no damsel more beauteous than the empress of Trolltalk, the peerless Cracky-chan. when Cracky-chan has an orgasm, the face she makes is the closest Mankind will ever be allowed to God. i would softly kiss her cute little nose and put my head next to her chest so i could hear her heart beat, and we'd fall asleep in eachothers arms cracky is like a ninja, who can only be killed by other ninjas. and since she is the most beautiful girl in the world she is for all intents and purposes immortal I fear that you have misunderstood Cracky-Chan's message of peace and love. It is OK to find Alice's continued failure at everything she attempts amusing, since everyone who is not Cracky-Chan is imperfect and thus lacks the incredible strength needed to resist this. However, you should realise after suitable meditation exercises in the light of the adorable red nose that the set of "pieces of poo in the world" is reserved for people such as Robert Mugabe, Bin Laden and anti-Cracky posters. It does not at this time contain Alice "failure" Ridley. Why? What did Cracky-Chan ever do to you other than be a nice and wonderful and loving person? Cracky-Chan never hurt anybody she is the living incarnation of pure innocence and beauty. Anybody who would even think about hurting Cracky-Chan is the most evil person alive. A hundred elephants each bearing a hundred buddhas crossed every conceivable cosmos an infinite number of times just to touch their foreheads to the ground at cracky-chan's feet. This really happened. Cracky-Chan did not create the path you walk. But the movements of atoms and galaxies are in her book, and she sees little difference between them. It is all in her book. One day she will lay it down, when the book is done, and what comes after that is still unwritten. Cracky-Chan continues to walk. Why would you want a statue of Cracky-Chan anyway? God meant her to be looked at in animation, observing the particularities of her graceful behaviour and her heart-warming smile not immobile. DOWN by the salley gardens my love and I did meet; She passed the salley gardens with little snow-white feet. She bid me take love easy, as the leaves grow on the tree; But I, being young and foolish, with her would not agree. In a field by the river my love and I did stand, And on my leaning shoulder she laid her snow-white hand. She bid me take life easy, as the grass grows on the weirs; But I was young and foolish, and now am full of tears. Cracky-chan is the nick given to an absolutely adorable girl with a red nose and cat ears whose pictures were posted on the 4chan site. It is unknown if the pictures were posted by a troll or if it was herself and got scared by the amount and content of the comments received. It is only imperfection that complains of what is imperfect. The more perfect we are, the more gentle and quiet we become towards the defects of others. Cracky-chan stood at rest in the midst of the world. And unto them she was shown forth incarnate; She found them all intoxicated. And she found none of them thirsty. And her soul was pained for the children of humankind, for they are blind in their hearts and cannot see. For, empty did they enter the world, and again empty they seek to leave the world. But now they are intoxicated. When they shake off their wine then they will have a change of heart. I assume you are attempting to disparage Cracky-chan. I assure you sir that

-------

The Sky Queen is our Mother and our guardian. But we must also guard Cracky. For She is all Humankind, and Humankind is no more than its faith and diligence in Cracky's name. An injury to that faith is an injury to Cracky and to every true believer. It is through affirmation of that faith that our greatest duty lies, but sometimes mere affirmation does not suffice and we must act against those who would harm the faith of humanity through heresy. For we are engaged in an unending war for the soul of the man. Though it may seem the fight will never end, there is victory even in the defeat we see threatening all around.
There is no greater proclamation of faith than to offer up our very lives to guard the soul of humanity. In this we win a victory greater in magnitude than the harm that any heretic can inflict, and so every battle is a shining triumph that the traitor and the apostate can never take away from us.
The rabbitfag leads two crimes. You turn away from the path of righteousness and you abandon the Sky Queen as the object of your devotion. For the first death is merely a just retribution. The second is a Heresy so terrible that no punishment can be sufficient. Yet the search for an appropriate penalty continues, and it shall be found.

It is official. Netcraft has now confirmed: Cracky-chan is dying

One more crippling bombshell hit the already beleaguered Cracky-chan community when Chansluts confirmed that Cracky-chan market share has dropped yet again, now down to less than a fraction of 1 percent of all stalkers. Coming on the heels of a recent Netcraft survey which plainly states that Cracky-chan has lost more stalkers, this news serves to reinforce what we've known all along. The circlejerk is collapsing in complete disarray, as fittingly exemplified by failing dead last in the recent 4chan comprehensive popularity test.

You don't need to be a Kreskin to predict Cracky-chan's future. The hand writing is on the wall: Lia faces a bleak future. In fact there won't be any future at all for Cracky-chan because Cracky-chan is dying. Things are looking very bad for Lia. As many of us are already aware, Lia continues to lose blood. Red blood flows like a river of ink.

Wish.kamistic.com is the most endangered of them all, having lost 93% of its circlejerkers. The sudden and unpleasant departures of long time Cracky stalkers Faux and Schwill only serve to underscore the point more clearly. There can no longer be any doubt: Wish is dying.

Let's keep to the facts and look at the numbers.

Mysterious Admin states that there are 70 users of .71. How many users of Wish are there? Let's see. The number of .71 versus Wish posts is roughly in ratio of 5 to 1. Therefore there are about 700/5 = 14 Wish users. Cracky-chan posts on Chansluts are about half of the volume of Wish posts. Therefore there are about 7 users of /006/. A recent article put /r9k/ at about 80 percent of the Cracky-chan fanbase. Therefore there are (70+14+7)*4 = 364 /r9k/ stalkers. This is consistent with the number of Cracky-related /r9k/ posts.

Due to the troubles of Bounceme, abysmal posts and so on, cracky.bounceme.net went out of business and was taken over by cracky.dreams.ro who stalk another troubled girl. Now cracky.dreams.ro is also dead, its corpse turned over to yet another charnel IP address.

All major surveys show that Cracky-chan has steadily declined in cuteness. Cracky-chan is very sick and her long term survival prospects are very dim. If Cracky-chan is to survive at all it will be among World of Warcraft guildmates. Cracky-chan continues to decay. Nothing short of a miracle could save the Skyqueen at this point in time. For all practical purposes, Cracky-chan is dead.

Fact: Cracky-chan is dying

You want to be fucked, Lia, but you don't want to have a bath with me.
I suspect that there's something extremely dreadful:
Either your breasts hang down ragged from your chest,
Or you fear that when you are nude you might betray the furrows of your belly,
Or your mangled groin gapes open with an infinite chasm,
Or something sticks out from the mouth of your cunt.
But, I trust, there's none of these things and you're very beautiful naked.
If that's true, you have a worse blemish: You're a fool.

Guys, I'm crying right now.
Cracky chan really is all I think about all day, every day. I really do cry myself to sleep at night thinking about how I'll never be with her. If only she knew I existed in this life, if only she knew my deep profound love for her. I know that will never happen though. That is the thought that makes me so sad when I look at her. I'll never be with her, but I'll continue to love her until the day I die.

I on the other hand am all about teh cracky-chan and would love to fondle her goodies. There is nothing more important than cracky-chan. NOTHING. Troll. Fuck you. Cracky-chan is cute and Mercatur is annoying, shrill, ugly, old, and evil. Also she's legal! RAWR! What would you do if cracky-chan were in the room with you right now?? Hug her. Tell her she's beautiful. Discuss Anime. Pinch or touch her adorable little red nose. Get an erection, feel guilty about it, and spend the rest of the night anonymously flaming yourself on Trolltalk, with one of your sockpuppet accounts accusing one of your others of being a pedophile. Strip her naked, write "20721" all over her body, take pictures, and upload them to Trolltalk just to prove a point that didn't need proving. Ask her how she'd like to have her tight little vagina pounded into a sloppy wet mess by the Living Incarnation of Pure Evil. She knows where to find you. Try to figure out how she got into your basement without your mom noticing. Take her to meet Mercatur so the Final Battle can begin. Naked DDR. This is an attempt to sort out the details of Cracky-chan's introduction to Trolltalk. A small (automated?) crapflood is run. Each message has the subject and body "cracky-chan" and each links to one of three pictures (though each picture is used multiple times). These are the three pics: This was the first Cracky-chan post on Trolltalk of all time, although it contained no link to a pic, just some random text: possibly a test of the script that was used to make the later posts. This was the first post of the pic flood, containg (as did all the other posts) 2-3 letters of seemingly random text. This first (02/02) flood was largely ignored. I didn't even look at the pics at the time because I always ignore crapflooded posts. They were drowned out by a GNAA crapflood going on at the same time. Nobody mentioned Cracky-chan for almost a week. I still hadn't seen a picture of her and still had no idea who she was. This post may or may not have been posted by the Cracky-chan pic poster. It didn't use the same syntax as the others. The link is now dead. I can't remember if it ever worked for me or not. It was definitely posted by somebody who knew about Cracky-chan, though, because it referenced 4chan. Almost a week later, after almost a week of silence on the Cracky-chan front, I presume that the original Cracky-chan picture poster returned (although it could've been somebody else) and posted messages similar to the previous Wednesday's messages, but with each picture being used only once, and with no random text. None of the previous pictures were repeated. These were the new pics: I saw these pictures of Cracky-chan and thought she was quite cute. I still hadn't posted anything about her. Some other people posted a few comments here and there... I'm not sure if they were the Cracky-chan pic poster or not. I now knew what Cracky-chan looked like, but I didn't know who she was or where these pictures were coming from. The original (?) Cracky-chan picture poster returns to post one and only one pic: This makes me curious (and horny) because I've heard of 4chan before but don't know what it is. I start doing research on cracky-chan and start posting fan messages about her to Trolltalk, as do others. I still don't know a lot about who she is, though, or what role she plays on 4chan, or why somebody decided to start spamming pics of her here. Whatever the answers to these questions are, I have just one thing to say: more cracky-chan pics please!!!

Cranky drew Nevada close against the dank dimness of their lonely cell. "Nevada-chan?" she asked. "Just call me Nevada," the younger girl replied. Cracky-chan smiled back. "Alright... Nevada. Do you think I'm cute?" "Yeah," she said, blushing hotly. A feeling she had never felt before built down below. "Like... cute enough to kiss?" "As in... cute enough to do other things with?" "No." Cracky-chan's expression shattered as she devolved into tears. Nevada-tan reached down with one hand, bringing Cracky-chan's head up to face her own. "But there's something that could make you that way." "What, what is it?" Cracky-chan sniffled. "This." The razor blade slid through her throat quicly and cleanly and a red torrent gushed from the wound. Cracky-chan's mouth gaped open and closed several times, like a fish, her eyes wide and uncomprehending, before she collapsed slowly to the ground. A pool of crimson spread around her corpse. "'Sup, 4chan," the younger girl mumbled. "Now, let's get down to business." She pulled off the clingy prison pants but did not let go of the razor... Trolltalk should adopt Cracky-Chan as its official darling, since she is a beautiful Nordic girl who embodies the care-free and fun life we trolls have come to love so much. What do you guys think? I am in full agreement with this post. She's so fucking cute and sweet.

I'll knock on her door on the preselected day. "What is it?" she asks, recognising me immediately from on the internet.
"Its time to go" I say, as i grab her hand and the bag that's standing next to her door, always there, in case of emergency, in case of an outbreak.
We quickly run through her front garden, knocking the garden gnome on the way to the carriage, for no apparent reason. With one perfected throw i hurl the luggage inside the coach, right through the window. "I'll pay for the window later!" I shout at the carter. We expeditiously hop on, and I give the coachman the sign to start rolling. "Do these people never clean their belongings" i beef, as i swipe some shattered glass from the satin seats. The carriage is rolling faster and faster, as we inspect the contents of the package. It was specially made for scenario's like this, and contained everything we would ever need. A pink m4, with a "hello kitty" sticker on it. And lots of ammo. And maybe some other stuff. Cracky had spend all her free time when she was not creating collages or playing dress up on optimising the speed she could assemble the m4. And now she's going to need it, because they were coming. We could hear their screams of terror, closing in quickly. Fool beasts, seemingly a cross between zombies and trolls, created to never let go of a prey, and able to track it down over great distances. They had no choice. Some evil mind had injected a pheromone into the air, the particles driving every weak mind into insanity. In the meta data, our biometric characteristics. They would only stop when i killed the creator of this bloodthirsty plan. The carriage had picked up great speed by now, but we knew we could not outrun them, so we opened fire. pew pew pew! Fire blasted from our cannons! Bones shattered, flesh tore and skin bled. (i had a small wound on my hand from the glass) The malice beasts went down easily, but it was not enough. They were coming from everywhere now. I had to know who their leader was. "There, go into that small passage!" i shouted at the driver. He pulled the reins to the left, the horses neighed, but we managed it. The passage was so small i couldn't climb out of the window, so i shot a few bullets through the roof and climbed on top. Meanwhile the zombie-trolls had bunched together in the small aisle, and my grenade launcher was super effective. I demanded the chauffeur to loan a horse, which i jumped upon and rode back to the pile of smouldering flesh (the gangway was a bit broader there, so i could cross the stagecoach), where i found one who was still a bit alive, his guts lying on the tiles. "who's your master!" i insisted.
"raglll i'll never tell you!"
I started pulling out his bowels slowly, broke his hands, pulled out his finger nails, gushed hydrochloric acid over his intestines by squeezing out his stomach, pulled out his teeth, roasted his hands, put a wedge in his spine, and he soon broke: "arg arg i don't know his name, but many consider him the king"
I knew enough. It was that ruffian whatbandage. I could have guessed it. He always had these nefarious plans, and this could only have been his doing. Riding back to the cariage, i quickly developed a plan. A MASTER PLAN!!!
"Come on Olivia, we'll do this part on horse"
The rest of the equipment from the bag was howled in a backpack, and so we rode.
"Here, into this building, all the way till the top. This building should suffice."
The sun was already going under the horizon, in different shades of deep red. It must be the particles, since it has been some time since i saw one this red. There were a bunch of small elongated fluffy clouds, but it was still pretty bright. When we arrived on the roof, we noticed something was wrong. "It's a trap!" cracky shouted, but i already knew. Enemys where coming from everywhere, my radar was filled with red dots. "I'll have to finish this quickly, before this quickly finishes me", and i grabbed my sniper rifle. We were galoping rapidly over the roof, towards the edge, while cracky was blasting the zombies coming from in front of us. I knew he was going to stand there, on the small pavilion, in the middle of the small park, about 400 meters down the street. I loaded the chamber and put the butt on my shoulder. There's the abyss.. As we made our horses jump to reach the other building, i could see him standing in a glimpse, between the 2 skyscrapers. The red sun straight behind us, making us invisible for him. For a split second, time seemed to freeze as i saw this person through my scope, his arms spread and wearing a sinister cloak, and chalk circles reaching into dark powers, it seemed like he was performing some sort of abstruse ritual. The cross hair passed over his head, and a jet of blood sprouted behind him. (the horse had to be in the air for maximum accuracy duh) Recoilless guns are awesome.
Meanwhile cracky was looking backwards, shooting some monsters who were trying to jump after us. Shit was soo cash.
We noticed the ghouls had calmed down, and we made our way to the train, whose black smoke we could see in the south, not promising much good.

-------

"retarded blatant nonsense!" (it's a mystery)
I noticed the bartender standing next him, but here he had changed his clothes to a medieval jester style fashion.
"blablalba fireball 10mana!" cracky mumbled, and cast the fireball, hurling it towards the low fallen assassin.
"i roll 15 and evade!" was his vicious reply.

-------

"aarg my beautiful castle! nnooooo my tender plants..." darrin was saddened by the loss of this plant, and he new many more would follow. Hopefully the walls would be spared.
Out of nowhere we suddenly heard the sound of THUNDER! no, it was the sound of a motorbike!
Over the walls comes flying at 150 km/hours, suede with his jacket on fire (maybe he had been leaking gas on his vest, and now with the friction it was ignited) , on his motorbike, with his deadly weapon of choice, a devastating chainsaw on a stick. The solo from "through the fire and flames" is playing, he jumps in front of the demon, and chainsaws 20 of the demon's eyes out in one move. The beast howls in pain, but reacts with lightning speed, extracting his razor fang cluster from his right hand, and before suede could safely land, he was ripped in 100 pieces, and flying upwards into space at 600km/hours. A scientifically proven magical petrification ray shooting device pops up from his right shoulder, and a disintegration ray from his left. The biggest scientifically proven magical petrification beam ever seen shoots and petrifying the pieces and bits left of suede, who were already starting to freeze in the cold depths of space. A disintegration beam quickly follows, and we know there's nothing we could do to save him no more, not even a phoenix down or a health potion. We see the demon had stepped to its left, and crushed the poor jester doing so.
"We need more fire power!" i shout.
"Cover me while i summon my cutie blood elf-satyr-type cloven-hoofed demon boy!" cracky shouts at me.
-"Demon boy? Are you mad? We're fighting a demon here, it could be it's father!"
"Its all i got", she says, and i begin casting my "blablalba aegis of auspicious incarnations 31 energy!"
Darrin is shooting bolts of lightning, and debuffing and stuff you'll usually do with a demon, while he was on the phone. The demon's attacks were fierce and hard, and we were running out of health potions.
The demon boy did some damage, and feinted. Cutie boys are not hardened and experienced enough to fight demons. "My mommy!" The demon cried. Looks like the boy wasn't his son, but the boy was his mother.
In this moment of disarray i put on my robe and wizard hat, and finished my easily interrupted 5 second spell (balbalba engulptions of reality into zero point space fuelled by dark matter 150energy ) Darrin had finished his call, and the hammer system was online, charged, and about to fire. Cracky opened her parasol and took a picture.
At the moment my spell hit, a bluish ball of something ranging 2 meters in diameters formed in front of the demon. Red engravings of ancient runes scarred themselves into the white marble stone underneath it. Half a second later, a big red-yellow beam struck down from the sky, doing massive damage. The hammer beam lasted for 10 seconds, and it appeared that it fuelled the blue ball of prospective void, enlarging it all the time. The runes and circles on the floor proliferated everywhere, on the walls, and seemingly in the sky, burning holes to other dimensions. Soon we found ourselves and half of the castle engulfed in this uncanny gloomy blue magical thing.
It seemed like ages, and then the beam stopped
ZA WARUDO!
All colours inverted, and the sky was black, as we felt the ball collapsing into a singularity and beyond, pure nothingness, drawing us in. Our body shapes shifted and with a bang it disappeared. ( bang bcs the vacuum was filled with air and stuff)
Half a tower of the castle remained, and the contours of a perfectly shaped ball were visible. The sky was blue again.

I would like to thank all of you for your loyal dedication to watching my journal, but I'm going friends only now.

Basic rule? No ugly people. I had to get rid of a couple of you already on account of this. Nothing personal, you understand.

Trolltalk (also known as 20721, sid 20721 or sid=20721) is a hidden story ID on the online news discussion forum Slashdot, where Slashdot trollers formerly conversed amongst themselves, sometimes demonstrating new trolling techniques, bragging about successful trolling and insulting each other. Trolltalk is the oldest active SID on Slashdot, and has received more posts over its lifetime than any other SID, but due to Slashcode's purge feature, only the most recent two weeks of posts remain at any given time. Although the two-week post count is usually in the thousands, at least 95% of the posts are intentionally content-free "crapfloods" generated by automated posting scripts, with the remaining handful being written by the various people who visit the forum. The current trolltalk was predated by an earlier thread with the textual SID "trolltalk". It was created in 2000, when, due to a bug, SlashCode allowed arbitrary alphanumeric SIDs. There were several other custom SIDs created during this time as well, such as "sid=2dollarcrackho", "sid=k223320inchfan" and "sid=10gramspoppylatex". When Slashdot was upgraded to SlashCode 2.0 the bug was fixed but there was a short-lived new feature called "user-created discussions" which featured numeric SIDs. Soon thereafter new trolltalks were created such as 20721, 31337 and 20384. With the exception of 20721 they have all been deleted or disabled over the years. 31337 was closed due to abuse, and the others were automatically deleted by Slashcode's purge feature after not receiving any posts for two weeks. Following the changes in Slashcode intended to make trolling harder by banning users for as little as one negative moderation, the discussion became highly variable. In the past, during non-crapflood periods when regular discussions took place on the sid, most of the conversations centered around dating tips, racist jokes and racism in general, discussions of Dance Dance Revolution and Alternate Reality Gaming, admissions and discussions of "cutting", various fanboy arguments, flaming of other past and present trolltalk users, and occasional attacks on various forums outside of Slashdot. The trolltalk community once claimed to exert significant pressure on Slashdot by creating huge threads where people would argue irrelevant and deliberately incorrect points. Although trolling on Slashdot is still an occasional pastime, much of the activity concerns easier targets, usually with a more naive userbase and less sophisticated (or absent) comment moderation system. The goal is often total destruction of a target forum/community via automated crapflooding, exploitation of security flaws and harassment of the site operators. Slashdot's moderation system is little used on trolltalk, since the community is relatively small and obscure, and its users rarely receive mod points. Due to this and the fact that few "normal" Slashdot users visit the SID it is essentially a zone without rules. In the past, the anonymous nature of trolltalk has led users to post nude photographs of themselves or to admit personal details about themselves that they would not otherwise admit, such as homosexuality, "cutting", or Ephebophilia. In the past, members of the community who are angry at having been insulted or losing an argument (or were simply bored) have used automated scripts to flood trolltalk with random messages for days or weeks, making any discussion nearly impossible. Crapfloods are a regular occurrence and are considered a part of trolltalk culture, although they frequently annoy users who wish to chat. During crapfloods, normal posting to trolltalk is typically reduced or eliminated until the crapflood ends, as has been the case during the current extended crapflooding of trolltalk that began around May 2005. Before discussion on trolltalk was mostly halted by the start of the current ongoing crapfloods, most of the discussion over the past year had been about two women, Cracky-chan and Mercatur. Although neither woman was a user of trolltalk, both had a number of fans there, and a bitter rivalry developed with fans of each waging violent flame-wars against fans of the other. Unknown parties registered the domain names cracky-chan.com and mercatur.org and turned them into redirects to trolltalk. As mentioned earlier, the current trolltalk is now under attack from a sophisticated crapflood, rendering trolltalk all but unusable except for the most avid readers. This was believed to have started to punish other trolltalkers who insulted the crapflooder. During the first weeks of the deluge, attempts were made to establish "crapflood bunkers"; because the crapflood was confined to the top level of the discussion, discussion was able to continue as normal in the replies to "bunker" comments.

Last night there was a thread with a girl named Cracky.There was all sorts of weird drama shit, but the girl was really cute. Does anyone have the address to bounce me?

 Contemplate
The human is a flawed and broken creature. Setting asunder the earth around them they act as the Caterpillar, consuming the very world they stand upon. Let not the darkness cloud your heart traveler, even this mindless destruction holds deep meaning and purpose. The Sky Queen gave us all the blessings of the earth to speed us on towards our metamorphosis. When we are satiated we will rest, and become unto the Butterfly freed of the shackles of physics. The universe will open to us. The devout does not show disrespect to the gifts the Holy Patron has given us. The faithful uses only what he needs in his studies and nothing more. Balance must be maintained to ensure that Her blessings remain for those who may one day find the true path.

Thought for the day: Ruthlessness is the kindness of the wise.

Honor Cracky by attempting to perfect your body and mind. Become the man worthy of the Avatar's love, create things of beauty to offer to the Queen of Heaven. Use your devotions to focus your mind on your tasks. Strive always to improve yourself through discipline. You stand among the chosen, it is your responsibility to show the heathens the truth with your mental, physical, and spiritual strength. Perfection is the provence of Cracky alone, the journey for it our offering to Her.

Hey Mero, I know we have had our disagreements and shit, but here me out on this. Scott Peck describes both neuroses and character disorders as disorders of responsibility, Peck writes; "The neurotic assumes too much responsibility; the person with a character disorder not enough. When neurotics are in conflict with the world, they automatically assume that they are at fault. When those with character disorders are in conflict with the world, they automatically assume the world is at fault."

From his book--"The Road Less Traveled"
"All of us have a smattering of neurotic and character disordered personality traits. The major problem in all of our lives is to decide and clarify our reponsibilities. To truly be committed to a life of honesty, love and discipline, we must be willing to commit ourselves to reality. This committment, according to Peck, 'requires the willingness and the capacity to suffer continual self-examination.' Such an ability requires a good relationship with oneself. This is precisely what no shame-based person has. In fact a toxically shamed person has an adversarial relationship with him/herself. Toxic shame--the shame that binds us--is the basis for both neurotic and character disordered syndromes of behaviour."

Reading into a few comments you made lately, it seems like you are taking too much shit on yourself. Maybe you just need to shut down the internet for awhile. Every time I take a little break from the internet I tend to reevalute my life and see that the little shit which has been driving me crazy is infact my own penchant to accept culpability in all situations. It is a defense mechanism in a way. It is the path of least resistance to blame yourself rather then another you have artificially built up in your mind as the be all and end all. Take a break, go camping at the beach this weekend and give your system a chance to work all those chemical you have been ingesting out.

Lia's so incredibly adorable and sweet. I'd take her to some fancy restaurant where we'd have a nice and playful argument over who's paying the bill (of course, we split it!) Then take a long romantic walk with her, arm-in-arm, and talking about serendipity, the occult, and politics. Then I'd invite her to my flat and we'd make love for a half hour, gently placing my erection cautiously into her mouth careful she didn't choke on my engorged manhood. I'd then proceed to ejaculate in the condom I was using. Then, as the ultimate love gift, I'd carry her in my arms to the tub and let my shower wash away any hint of the indignity we'd done together. I'd whisper "I love you" and give Lia a tender smile, and sever her jugular with a singular slice of my sterile razorblade. Covered in her own warm blood, she'd look straight into my very soul with nothing but scorn and contempt for my myriad sins. A bubble of blood and saliva would burst between her lips, then she'd start shivering as shock set in. Actually, it'd take at least a few minutes for her to bleed to death and the entire experience would be rather dreadful. After some additional lovemaking, I'd embalm her to ensure she remained pristene forever. Three weeks later, some playing children will find the pictures I posted of her flawless, lifeless visage on 4chan.

They will be be quite jealous and request MOAR.

I've been trying to put order into the whole drama history around cracky-chan, her pictures, livejournals and the related shenannigans going on in 4chan's /b/ and elsewhere. This is a first rough draft, so help me out with additional knowledge or correct me where I might have been wrong, please.

January 6th

The first cracky-chan pics appear on /b/. The very first one, posted on
02:17 shows the soon to be famous "'sup 4chan" phrase written on the
palm of her hand. During the next two weeks, more sets appear on /b/
and W.T. Snacks finds out that the poster's IP is from the UK.

February 5th

"cracky" becomes wordfiltered on /b/.

March 29th

www.livejournal.com/users/freakygirl/ becomes publically known.
No new pics appear, but the hints solidify and people assume they have
got into contact with the real cracky-chan. The owner of cracky-chan.com
will later denounce this journal as fake, though this might have been a move
to protect her identity, as he also later takes down all of her real pictures
from his website.
Also, later on, another journal, whether fake or real, becomes known:
www.livejournal.com/users/kittycat/

April 3rd

cracky-chan's tripcode becomes publically known through shii:
shii.org/bbs/blog/pivot/entry.php?id=65
It is "sweet" and makes the claim that the original cracky-chan pictures
weren't originally posted by her herself more believable.

April 6th, 7th

www.livejournal.com/users/scarecrowmaiden becomes publically known,
many new cracky-chan pics appear on /b/, some nude, some disturbing,
some both. The journal gets deleted by the owner very quickly.

June 6th

cracky-chan pics become bannable even on /b/.
Anonymous mods talk of emails from cracky requesting this.

Originally intended as a site to share anime and manga images when it was launched in 2003, 4chan is now known for its affiliation with the hacktivist group Anonymous (whose members somehow got 4chan's founder, Christopher Poole, voted Time's Most Influential Person of 2008 by manipulating the poll), its memes (pretty much anything that's ever gone viral began there), and its offensive content (as Senft, the academic, said: "For adults, 4chan is sort of the ninth circle of Hell.")

Cracky would post photos that were, in a word, dark. First, there was a series in which she smeared her face with menstrual blood. In others, she would take on personas, like that of a gothic nurse. Often, Cracky seemed lonely and sad, which made her instantly endearing to anime nerds. The fact that her costumes made her look like a character also bred an obsession.

Stalkers then tracked down the girl's online journal, which was filled with more photos that were shared among collectors like priceless treasures or rare trading cards.

Cracky appeared on 4chan only a few times before the stalker-like mob forced her self-imposed exile from the web. Today, she has pretty much disappeared, so it's impossible to know her motivation for posting. But generally, it's clear that 4chan's camgirls were experimenting with their burgeoning sexuality and competing with one another for male approval.

Although every camgirl has both fans and mockers, none has received as much attention as Cracky. She hasn't posted any images since 2007 and is now in her mid-20s, but her fansites are updated regularly. Old photos are posted with comments such as "how do i not be obsessed with cracky" and "She must be at least twenty now. Probably living a nice life. Friends, etc. I want to die."

How To Prepare Cracky:

Ingredients:
1 cup olive oil
1 stick butter
Hemp twine
Somethings to stuff her with

Instructions:

Gently remove Cracky's wrappings
Carefully wash all of Cracky's openings and cavities
Smear butter under Cracky's breast skin
Smear more butter between Cracky's thighs
Massage oil all over Cracky
Stuff Cracky until she's completely full
Sew Cracky shut.
Bind Cracky's thighs
Cover Cracky in foil
Bake Cracky at 350F for about 2000 minutes.
When you insert a probe into the deepest, thickest parts of Cracky it should read at least 160.
Baste only if it please you.

If you do it right Cracky will always come out better than turkey. Bon Apetit!

I saw Her then. She was exactly in the spot she where we had met before, only the battle had pushed and pulled itself back over the same spot. The battle, which Antoni and my men were apparently losing, had left her behind. She was alone in the open field.

She was in the exact same position, atop her mutilated horse which stood in a self replicating puddle of rats. Her blue, pleated skirt was simply a tatter wrapped across the rigid waist of her full plate suit of armour. Her blue tie, however, was pristine. Her entire body, from neck to feet, was wrapped loosely in bandages. She was looking down at the ground. Her eyes stared straight into the earth and rapidly scanned back and forth, as though examining this precise placement, wondering why, of all the places, she was in this one specifically.

The Queen of the sky stirred. Her scraggly, braided green hair turned grey and fell out. Red buds quickly sprouted from her head and grew to her neck. She turned her head towards me, while casting her eyes down to avoid my gaze. Cracks appeard in her polished steel armour, running from her heart towards her fingertips. From where the cracks intersected, blood issued forth at a drip. From beneath her skirt bubbling black pitch began to flow. It was flowing slowly at first. As I watched the flow accelerated and small foetuses began to appear in the stream. The sticky pitch sizzled and burnt the horse as it crawled downwards carrying the abortive children. When the Sky Princes and Princesses were finally ejected by the drooping pitch, they fell towards the ground and were feasted upon by the swarming vermin. All that ate the foetuses died. All that ate the dead, died. The pitch then dissolved the lifeless vermin into more steaming tar. Soon there was nothing between her legs but death.

As I watched the demonstration, I felt as though she might know my pain of being surrounded by the living, while being only able to love the dead. She snapped her eyes towards me then. She did not look into my eyes. She had no need to, for she saw into my soul long before we had ever actually met. As she allowed me to stare into her eyes, I fell into her. I saw her soul was a place equally barren and dead as my own. It was this place she was trying to express into reality. I knew she understood me as no other person in existence or beyond would ever be able to. I saw her all encompassing empathy for me, for what I was. I saw that she understood what would happen next; she knew I thought she was the most perfect and beautiful woman in the world that could ever live; she knew why she could never bend me to her and make me love her:

She was not dead.

I dropped my sword, and my shield. I hadn't had much use for them anyways. I removed my armour, too. I stood there in the cold, completely naked. The bandages around her unravelled, and reached out for me. The softly wrapped around my wrists, they bound both my ankles together, and then lifted me. Her bandages scrolled back around her as she brought me nearer. I couldn't break contact with her eyes. She pulled me close.

She had let so many thousands of men look into her heart; she drove each one of them completely insane as they tried and failed to comprehend what was inside. Aftewards, each of them inexplicably had set out to find for her what she had lost. I realized then how other men looked into her; they only saw her as beautiful for what she had once been, a happy little girl. They had all felt as though a world which could destroy such naive innocence was a world that should be destroyed itself. The world and the people that made it, should all be punished for what it had done to the one divinely innocent being they had ever known.

As they all punished the world, they began a search to find that part deep inside of her that had been lost so long ago. They swarmed around her, capturing land, destroying cities. They raped young girls and built cathedrals to house their bulging, pregnant bodies. They brought the babies to be sacrificed. They had bathed their Queen in the babies' blood, believing somehow they could transfer that essense of innocence BACK. As though they could cast out all the pain in the world by inflicting more pain to the world. In doing so, her followers had excoriated any slightest hint that was left inside Cracky's heart.

And they had damaged tens of thousands of other girls. My mind reeled into the future, and I saw how each tormented, pregnant child was herself destined to become a painful echo of the Sky Queen in her own time. But that is not mine to solve. I, myself, am the key to releasing this Cracky from this curse. I know the secret to it now. To be a grown woman, and yet to yearn for childhood. And to always be surrounded by nothing but toys. Dolls. Playthings.

She wrapped her arms around me and embraced me. I put my hands around her throat. She kept looking into my eyes. I felt her pulse race. It began to slow.

I don't know when the beating ceased. Her eyes stayed open, and I fell into them again. Her soul was empty now. I saw all those bubbling adult foetuses replaced by emptiness. Calmness. Beauty. I took the reigns of the horse, and I left the battle behind. There will be a new Sky Queen, a new reluctant angel. You can destroy an entire planet, but you can't kill a single Cracky. You can only release her from her torment.

attention cracky-chan fanboxen

i have as-of-yet unreleased cracky-chan pictures and will post them as soon as someone shows why x^x == e^(x*ln(x)) and how exactly they figured this out.

-------

 A hundred elephants each bearing a hundred buddhas crossed every conceivable cosmos an infinite number of times just to touch their foreheads to the ground at cracky-chan's feet. This really happened.

-------

 I wonder if her nose is super-sensitive. She probably has an orgasm every time she touches it.

-------

I also doubt that you'll get much pussy if everything older than Cracky-Chan is too old for you.

godamnit you fucken jerks

stop calling me cracky chan and leave me alone you losers need to get a life

Hey dumbass
What makes you think cracker chan is SMART?

**

I can tell by looking in her eyes and at the way she smiles. :)

**

Wishful thinking, I'd say.

**

Sorry we can't all be cynical bastards who hate life, like you.

**

Sorry we can't all be vain bastards who are pedophiles, like yuo.

**

God you're a dumbshit. You have no evidence for either of those accusations because they're both false. You're a miserable troll and a miserable person. Your mother should have had an abortion.

**

Yuo are vain in thinking her ugly smile is intelligent. You are a pedophile in being attracted to a very young, underdeveloped girl.

**

If her smile is "ugly" then how am I vain for seeing personality in it? I'd say YOU are vain for judging her based solely on physical appearance (although I think she's extremely beautiful in physical appearance) and I am not.

**

You are vain in imagining that she posseses qualities that you find particularly attractive. How much can her eyes and smile reveal about her intelligence?

Flooding a message board and attention-whoring in general makes her rather stupid, in fact.

**

I'm sorry but I'm just a good judge of character. I understand more about human nature than you do. A person's personality will be reflected in the way she moves, carries herself, smiles, how she holds her eyebrows, etc. Acknowledging and studying this isn't vanity, it's intellect. Have you never heard of "body language"? Those who fully understand it have power in the real world over those who don't know how to read the physical signals that people subconsciously give off from their minds through their bodies and faces.

Do you have any evidence that cracky-chan flooded a message board? No. Do you have any evidence that she attention-whored? No.

p.s. Smart people have a "glimmer" in their eyes. You can see the shine of intelligence and creativity. Stupid people have cold, dead eyes.

Take a pic of cracky-chan and a pic of Mercatur. Compare the eyes. You will see the difference.

She flooded 4-chan (I think the specific thread was deleted/purged)

proof [img220.exs.cx]

Attention whoring like this is the desperate behavior of a stupid person.

**

Do you have any evidence that she was involved in the 4Chan flooding?

How do you know that the person posting pictures of her there was really her? It could have been a friend of hers or her boyfriend or some random online person who claimed his name was "4chan" and got her to do a photo greeting for him.

question about cracky-chan

is she mature enough to menstruate yet? I would dearly love to eat out her blood-soaked vagina

**

Yuo are sick. I hope you burn in hell. Only a twisted mindfuck who can't have a relationship with a real woman would say such a thing.

**

not everyone can get off on 400 pound slovenians, Scottpanda

Cracky-chan is more of a real woman than you could ever handle, n00b.

**

I would like to eat out ms. chan while she is mestrauting and has a yeast infection. That would be totally hot!

**

Girls start menstruating very young these days. Cracky-chan has probably been bleeding for years and years, even if the youngest estimates of her age (14) are correct, certainly if the older estimate (17) is correct.

 I don't think Cracky-Chan has already developed any goodies to fondle. Give her another few years.

**

Lies.

**

No goodies in sight, sir! [img146.exs.cx]

**

Because she's wearing a SHIRT.

**

No hints of goodies under that shirt.

**

How would YOU know what's under her shirt?

It's a loose fitting shirt. She's a young nubile teen with small, firm breasts. She very much has got the goodies.

**

If she had boobs of an acceptable size, you would be able to see them from the outside.

Cracky-Chan has a huge gaping vagina the size of a hallway.

**

I'm rather into that shit.

-------

but wouldn't the adorably cute cracky-chan fall under the hot non-nude teens category (SHE'S LIKE A FUNCTOR ON YOUR NATURAL TRANSFORMATION FORMED FROM THE COMPOSITION OF CATAMORPHISMS AND PARAMORPHISMS)

clearly this is the case thus your list has been proven invalid by contradiction and thus the theory T with the model M is a contradictory theory and thus worthless

-------

 OH NOES!!!111

I beg your forgiveness and will only speak in the highest terms of cracky chan from now on!!

you penis licking retard.

-------

please note that I, the creator of Penis-Nosed Fox will hencewith demand royalties for each posting of the aforementioned Fox.

Each use of PNF will cost 1 EUR (that's about 27 USD at current exchange rates) while PPPPenis-Nosed Fox comes at the bargin price of 13 cents.

However, if anyone can point me to a nude (or white panties and knee-length socks only) picture of Cracky-Chan, I will release Penis-Nosed Fox into the public domain.

Cracky-Chan

    Doesn't even have a cam
    Is underage and somewhat ugly
    Is a wapanese furry freak

-------

    >psychologically more healthy

furry ears?

-------

I want to drink cracky-chan's vaginal secretions.

-------

hi cracky-chan, (if that is your real name). what motivates you to post pictures of yourself on 4chan? tell me about your childhood. does the attention make up for a lack of parental attention and nuturing as a child?

-------

 Cracky Chan was born in 1990. She is 14 years old. This other chick is 17. Not the same person.

**

Do you have any evidence that Cracky is that young? She looks older. Either way, she's truly totally the most adorable person alive.

**

How the fuck can you tell how old a girl is just by looking at her? I call bullshit.

-------

 stfu this sid is for pix of cracky chan get with the program master chief

-------

But you could always hang out with that "cracky" chick wearing the furry ears. She looks harmless enough for you and probably won't hurt your fragile ego. You two would also be a better match age-wise, since you seem somewhat underequipped in the brain-area for dealing with those nasty over 20 year olds.

-------

You already posted this picture. Please post new pictures of this wonderful girl.

-------

A.) If you want Cracky-chan, she's in /b/. This is News for VIP.
B.) Cracky-chan only posts when she's drunk or high.
C.) It is also possible Cracky-chan will respond to your questions exactly 24 hours after you have sex. Only sex with a human counts. And they have to consent.

cracky-chan
A cosplayer girl that has crooked teeth and is fanatised (sexually) by the pedos on slashdot.
I love cracky-chan. She looks like an anime character that I'd have anal sex with!

-------

crackyhouse makes me feel sick and dirty
.71 is dumb

-------

Hey Cracky-haters

Why are you here?

if you hate Cracky why not go to a Boxxy board or something

or just kill yourself

Cranky drew Nevada close against the dank dimness of their lonely cell.

"Nevada-chan?" she asked.

"Just call me Nevada," the younger girl replied.

Cracky-chan smiled back. "Alright... Nevada. Do you think I'm cute?"

"Yeah," she said, blushing hotly. A feeling she had never felt before built down below.

"Like... cute enough to kiss?"

"As in... cute enough to do other things with?"

"No." Cracky-chan's expression shattered as she devolved into tears.

Nevada-tan reached down with one hand, bringing Cracky-chan's head up to face her
own. "But there's something that could make you that way."

"What, what is it?" Cracky-chan sniffled.

"This." The razor blade slid through her throat quicly and cleanly and a red torrent gushed from the wound. Cracky-chan's mouth gaped open and closed
several times, like a fish, her eyes wide and uncomprehending, before she collapsed slowly to the ground. A pool of crimson spread around her corpse.

"'Sup, 4chan," the younger girl mumbled. "Now, let's get down to business."

She pulled off the clingy prison pants but did not let go of the razor...

Sup internet, I'm a 26 year old lady who's been developing a science-based, 100% Cracky MMO for the last 16 years. I'm finally making my beta-website now, and using my 3D work as a base to create my 50+ concept images. Wish me luck, Chansluts; You'll be the first to see the site when it's finished.

-------

I’ve commented here before and I can see why this comes off as trolling but it’s a genuine question. My bf goes to the wash room often for a little too long and the toilet never flushes which I assumed was just him wanting his jerk off time. However, I went through his phone recently and discovered a lot of pictures of Cracky-chan I’m a sexual context (that being Cracky with large breast and as a women). He likes anime so I knew he has a thing for changirls as so do I but, this makes me quite questionable on his intentions with these photos. Should I confront him about this? Is it probably a lighthearted joke? He talks about Cracky-chan often as he does like the girl and I often gift him items of the girl thinking it’s just a cute and sweet thing. What should I do? Asking for actual advice. Thank you.

Fellas, is it gay to love Cracky?

-------

I saw Cracky at a grocery store in Los Angeles yesterday. I told her how cool it was to meet her in person, but I didn’t want to be a douche and bother her and ask her for photos or anything. He said, “Oh, like you’re doing now?” I was taken aback, and all I could say was “Huh?” but she kept cutting me off and going “huh? huh? huh?” and closing her hand shut in front of my face. I walked away and continued with my shopping, and I heard her chuckle as I walked off. When I came to pay for my stuff up front I saw her trying to walk out the doors with like fifteen Milky Ways in her hands without paying. The boy at the counter was very nice about it and professional, and was like “Ma'am, you need to pay for those first.” At first she kept pretending to be tired and not hear him, but eventually turned back around and brought them to the counter. When he took one of the bars and started scanning it multiple times, she stopped him and told him to scan them each individually “to prevent any electrical infetterence,” and then turned around and winked at me. I don’t even think that’s a word. After he scanned each bar and put them in a bag and started to say the price, she kept interrupting him by yawning really loudly.

-------

Isn't it weird how Anonymous went for "Cracky-chan" instead of something simpler like "Crack-chan" or "Coke-chan"?

-------

Imagine you could go back in time to a single specific moment and make a single specific change.

You are given a chance to prevent yourself from ever learning who Cracky is.

That's the only change you can make. You can only save your past self, nobody else. But you, and only you, have a chance to escape the cycle. Your past self will get a second chance at life, never knowing what was taken from them. Your present self will be cut free from fate and drift gently into oblivion.

Would you do it?
